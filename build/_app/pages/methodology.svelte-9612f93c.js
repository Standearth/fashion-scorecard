\r
\r
<p>The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report issued a \u201Ccode red\u201D for humanity and painted an alarming picture of the future of our climate if the world fails to drastically reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. As one of the biggest drivers of climate pollution, fashion companies must move decisively to break their dependence on fossil fuels, spurring the rapid transition to renewable energy and fossil free fabrics we need to safeguard a livable future.</p>`,re=`<h3>Manufacturing Powered by Coal</h3>\r
\r
\r
<p>Climate scientists and global agreements have underscored that the world must phase out the use of coal for energy by 2030 if we are to curb the worst impacts of climate change.<span class=footnote><sup>[1]</sup></span> Despite this, burning coal for electricity remains a key component of the grid mix in countries such as China, Vietnam and Turkey, where fashion brands manufacture many of their products. For example, according to the International Energy Agency, coal makes up 47% of the electricity grid in Vietnam.<span class=footnote><sup>[2]</sup></span> In-house supply chain research by the Stand Research Group uncovered that in 2019 the companies included in the Scorecard collectively imported more than 216,682 metric tonnes of apparel and related goods from Vietnam into the United States alone. </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Unless fashion brands invest in the decarbonization of energy grids in countries like Vietnam, whose economies are driven in no small part by textile and apparel manufacturing, and put pressure on both supply chain partners and policymakers to increase the deployment of renewable energy, coal power will continue to be a major source of energy in the fashion industry, and may in fact expand. Vietnam\u2019s proposed Power Development Plan for the period of 2021-2030 aims to increase the capacity of coal-fired power plants in the country by 30 gigawatts (GW) \u2013 enough to power more than 22 million American homes \u2013 with 24 new coal power plants being proposed. In addition to the filthy fuel\u2019s severe climate impacts, the potential expansion of coal in the country would cause 1,500 additional premature deaths every year in Vietnam.<span class=footnote><sup>[3]</sup></span> </p>`,le=`<p>In addition to coal-based electricity, the fashion industry continues to rely heavily on coal-fired water boilers, used in the fabric dyeing and finishing processes, and contributes to vast amounts of GHG emissions and deadly air pollution in communities surrounding manufacturing facilities. Thermal coal continues to be responsible for a major proportion of emissions originating from Tier 2 of the apparel industry supply chain, which is estimated to produce 40% of the industry\u2019s entire emissions.</p>\r
\r
\r
<h3>Fracked Fashion and Fossil Fuel Fabrics</h3>\r
\r
\r
<p>Synthetic materials derived from fossil fuels such as crude oil and fracked gas now constitute roughly two-thirds of all fibers used in textiles and garments.<span class=footnote><sup>[4]</sup></span> The production of fossil fuel fabrics is much more energy-intensive than plant-based materials such as organic cotton. In fact, the production of fossil fuel fabrics, including polyester, nylon and acrylic, accounts for 15 to 20% of the fashion sector\u2019s climate emissions.<span class=footnote><sup>[5]</sup></span> </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>The dependence on cheap fossil fuel derived fabrics such as polyester has enabled the highly-polluting fast fashion model, and the projected growth in the use of these plastic fibers, fueled by the fracking boom, will only perpetuate the fast fashion problem, undermining the sector\u2019s efforts to drastically cut emissions and to shift to circular production.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>The environmental footprint of these fabrics extends beyond the GHG emissions associated with extraction and production, to their massive contribution to the global plastic pollution crisis through the shedding of plastic microfibers that scientists have detected in every corner of the planet as well as in the human body. </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Despite growing opposition to hydraulic fracking by communities and policymakers, including increasing government bans on this method of fossil fuel extraction, Stand.earth Research Group researchers have uncovered major supply chain links from U.S. fracked gas to polyester producers supplying the global apparel industry. The research tracked ethane \u2013 used to produce ethylene \u2013 from fracked gas coming from Texas and Pennsylvania to Ineos, a major European importer of ethane. (Texas and Pennsylvania shipped over 1.3 million tonnes of ethane to Europe in 2019, mostly to Ineos). Ineos manufactures ethylene oxide and its derivative monoethylene glycol, from which polyester is derived, and is the largest producer of ethylene oxide in Western Europe, with a capacity of 935,000 tons annually. The research estimates around one-third of Ineos\u2019 capacity ends up as polyester fiber used by the fashion industry, including polyester made by the Ineos\u2019 customer Indorama Ventures, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of polyester fiber.</p>`,ce=`<p>The continued dependence on fossil fuel synthetics will contribute to driving the sector\u2019s GHG emissions and undermine global progress in curbing the demand for fossil fuels. As a result, fashion brands can no longer ignore the carbon footprint and local impacts of their fracked and other fossil fuel fabrics if they are serious about meeting their climate reduction targets and commitment to sustainability.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Growing consumer consciousness of the environmental and social harms associated with fast fashion presents a golden opportunity for fashion brands to rethink the design of their products to make them last longer. Replacing plastic materials such as polyester with non-fossil fuel derived synthetics is a critical first step toward a slower and more circular fashion business model.</p>\r
\r
\r
<h3>Shipping Emissions</h3>\r
<p>The sprawling global supply chain of the fashion sector is already an important driver in the growth of emissions from ocean freight and air cargo shipments, sectors that are heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Each mode is responsible for 2 to 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is rapidly increasing. Apparel and textiles were among the largest market segments in both ocean and air shipping in 2019, with 8% of ocean cargo freight volume and 6% of air cargo.<span class=footnote><sup>[6]</sup></span> Container ships also contribute significantly to air pollution due to their reliance on toxic heavy fuel oil. Ocean shipping is projected to increase to 17% of global GHG emissions if no action is taken. Apparel and textiles were among the largest market segments in both ocean and air shipping in 2019, with 8% of ocean cargo freight volume and 6% of air cargo.<span class=footnote><sup>[7]</sup></span></p>\r
<p>As one of the largest customers of both ocean and air freight, fashion and apparel brands have an opportunity to serve as critical catalysts in reducing emissions from air freight and to drive the investment needed in both ships and port infrastructure to decarbonize cargo vessels by the end of the decade. Several global brands have begun to engage on pilot approaches to reduce their shipping footprint, but much stronger demand for decarbonization, along with near-term demands requiring the elimination of toxic heavy fuel oil by cargo ship fleet operators serving major fashion brands, could help trigger much needed investment in zero-emission ocean freight.</p>`,pe=`<ol><li>\r

\r
\r
<p>The first step on the pathway to corporate decarbonization is to set ambitious climate targets that meet the need of the moment. The moment we are currently in \u2013 having less than one decade to dramatically reduce global GHG emissions \u2013 dictates we must slash total absolute global emissions 55% from 2018 levels by 2030 in order to keep global warming below 1.5\u2103.<span class=footnote><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>\r
\r
\r
<p>The fashion sector's climate ambition is not meeting the moment we are in. Despite important progress that has been made under the UN Fashion Climate Charter, establishing a 30% reduction in supply chain emissions by 2030 as a benchmark agreed to by 128 companies, the near daily reminder of floods, fires, and heat is reaffirming the science that much more dramatic reduction in pollution is needed by 2030. With notable exceptions, companies are not yet setting strong enough climate targets and the sector is on an emissions trajectory far from a 1.5\u2103 pathway. Setting strong climate targets should not be overlooked, because they serve as the blueprint for implementation plans and send powerful signals to the market for greater demand for renewable energy solutions. The recent decision by the Sustainable Apparel Coalition to require a 45% reduction target as a requirement of its members is an important step toward increasing the sector's ambition at a broad level.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>However, strong climate targets should cover the entire value chain and must result in absolute reductions. Intensity-based climate targets link emissions reductions to a performance based on units or revenue, potentially allowing a company to continue to grow its output without reducing total emissions. While intensity-based targets can play a useful role in assessing progress toward decarbonizing the value chain, they should be complemented with clear absolute GHG reduction targets or 100% renewable energy goals that apply across the supply chain. </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Some companies evaluated in the Scorecard have set intensity-based climate targets in scope 3 instead of absolute targets (see table below). These intensity-based targets fall short of the ambition required, especially when measured against companies that have set absolute targets, such as Mammut\u2019s 55% reduction by 2030 or Asics\u2019 63% reduction in emissions by 2030 (from purchased goods and services and end-of-life treatment of sold products).</p>`,ue="<p>Because more than 90% of the average company\u2019s climate pollution is generated in the manufacturing supply chain,<span class=footnote><sup>[4]</sup></span> it is critical that companies set supply chain targets ambitious enough to meet the scale required to align with the Paris Accord 1.5\u2103 pathway. </p>",me=`<h3>Importance of Transparency</h3>\r
\r
\r
<p>Without a clear understanding where the carbon is buried in any given supply chain, it is impossible to assess a company\u2019s progress in reaching its climate targets. Leading companies regularly make public their GHG emissions, energy demand, and the specifics associated with renewable energy purchase and use across entire value chains, and publish up-to-date supplier lists. Companies meeting the level of leadership defined here in their own operations include Inditex, M&S, Nike, Patagonia, PUMA, REI, VAUDE, and VF Corp; but Nike stood out as the only company to exhibit leadership with respect to transparency on its climate emissions and energy use across its entire value chain. </p>\r
\r
\r
<h3>Renewable Energy Commitments</h3>\r
\r
\r
<p>Renewable energy targets of 100% in scopes 1 and 2 are common, though there is significant variation in the impact of procurement strategies to achieve 100% renewable goals. Climate leaders will ensure that the renewable energy will be both local and additional to the grid \u2013 as opposed to continuing to rely on coal or other fossil fuel based electricity \u2013 while purchasing credits for renewable energy in a different location. But companies must also set renewable energy targets, covering manufacturing whether under direct control of the company or not. </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>This level of leadership is currently very rare within the fashion sector. Mammut, an outdoor apparel brand, stood out in this regard by recently committing to switching to 100% renewable energy in its entire supply chain, including manufacturing operations not directly under its control. This level of ambition sets an example for other brands to follow. In addition to Mammut, four of the companies assessed in this scorecard have publicly set renewable energy targets in the supply chain, notably three of which are footwear brands: </p>\r
<ul>\r
<li>Allbirds has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy for Tier 1 suppliers.<span class=footnote><sup>[5]</sup></span> </li>\r
<li>Asics states it will achieve 85% renewable electricity in Tier 1 by 2030.<span class=footnote><sup>[6]</sup></span> </li>\r
<li>PUMA has a commitment to source 25% renewable energy with core suppliers.<span class=footnote><sup>[7]</sup></span></li>\r
</ul>\r
\r
\r
<p>Fashion brands can also look to other sectors for examples of leadership in renewable energy commitments and action. The IT sector, which has a geographically overlapping supply chain, has extended their 100% renewable energy goals to their supply chains. </p>`,ge=`<ol><li>UNEP (2020). Emissions Gap Report 2020.

A number of leading brands demonstrated some progress in flattening emissions through gains in energy efficiency, but the lack of focus on how fossil fuel investments are being made in their supply chain countries and resistance to partnering with suppliers by providing meaningful incentives to transition to renewable manufacturing is the core reason that the sector is so far from a 1.5\u2103 pathway. Of the 47 companies evaluated in the Scorecard, only six companies have demonstrated progress in deploying renewable energy in their supply chain, even fewer at any meaningful scale.</p> \r
<p>Renewable energy is already the cheapest source of new power generation in most of the world, with the average global purchase for new utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind turbines able to beat or compete with even the cheapest and newest coal plants.<span class=footnote><sup>[1]</sup></span> Corporate demand for renewable energy, triggered by the growing number of companies who have set 100% renewable energy commitments, has become one the largest drivers of new renewable electricity generation in many markets. </p>\r
<p>While some fashion leaders have taken meaningful steps to transition their own operations to renewable energy (Nike, Patagonia, and VF Corp), most fashion brands lag far behind in transitioning their supply chain to renewables. A recent <a rel=external target=_new href=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Net_Zero_Challenge_The_Supply_Chain_Opportunity_2021.pdf>analysis commissioned by the World Economic Forum</a>, while confirming the fashion sector\u2019s supply chain as one of the largest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions, also highlighted that fashion brands have the potential to reduce emissions by 50 to 60% by 2030 at low cost by focusing on transitioning their manufacturing base to renewable energy.</p>\r
<p>Unfortunately, while most countries are rapidly phasing out coal and scaling renewable electricity deployment, the manufacturing base of global fashion brands is heavily concentrated in the few countries in the world that are expanding their reliance on coal and other fossil fuels for electricity generation. While a significant number of proposed coal plants in Vietnam and Bangladesh have fortunately been scrapped in the past year, much of the required energy demand will be replaced with proposed imported LNG, potentially locking fashion brands and their suppliers into high-cost investments that will make it impossible to reduce manufacturing emissions at the scale needed by 2030.</p>\r
<h3>Measuring Leadership Toward Fossil Free Manufacturing </h3>\r
<p>Without stronger standards of reporting and commitment to additionality of supply (see below), there is a real danger that shortcuts being used by some companies to report progress toward their GHG or 100% renewable goals will weaken the resolve of current corporate renewable leaders to pursue high impact strategies. Without a deeper investigation, it is increasingly difficult to tell the difference between the renewable claims of a company that is actually pursuing a high impact strategy that is changing the energy mix on the grid from a similar sounding claim to be \u201Cclimate positive,\u201D \u201Cclimate neutral,\u201Dor \u201CNet Zero,\u201D but is green in name only, as level of fossil fuels powering the factories remains largely unchanged.</p>\r
\r
\r
<h4>Energy Efficiency Gains and Lack of Facility Level Reporting</h4>\r
<p>Improving energy efficiency in the most energy-intensive areas of the apparel supply chain is a critical first step toward phasing out coal and replacing the reduced energy demand with renewable sources of energy. Leading companies are investing in capacity-building programs and financial incentives to help their suppliers drive significant improvements in energy efficiency, as most clearly evidenced by Levi\u2019s, PUMA, and VF Corp\u2019s work with a number of their priority suppliers via programs run by the IFC and the Clean by Design program now run by the Apparel Impact Institute (Aii). </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>However, with few exceptions, reporting on progress in improving energy efficiency remains largely anecdotal, due in great part to the lack of detailed reporting of energy demand by the brands themselves. While more detailed factory-level data is reported to Higg Co. by a growing number of suppliers, this data is not made public. As an illustration, Levi\u2019s, despite pre-pandemic GHG emissions from supply chain manufacturing 13% higher than its 2016 base year, saw its sales double in the same period, a potentially good indicator of meaningful improvements in energy efficiency by its 50-plus suppliers participating in IFC\u2019s PaCT program. However, the lack of factory-level data and Levi\u2019s own lack of detailed reporting of supply chain emissions, including reporting the exact same GHG emissions footprint for manufacturing emissions for three consecutive years, casts some doubt on the level of efficiency improvements achieved, putting much greater focus on the 13% increase in supply chain GHG pollution.</p>\r
\r
\r
<h4>Phasing Out Coal Boilers</h4>\r
<p>Coal is used in two distinct ways in the manufacturing of apparel: to generate the electricity that factories use through local electric grids, and by burning it onsite for industrial boilers. Wet processes like textile dyeing are responsible for a large percentage of the fashion industry\u2019s emissions that derive from onsite burning of fossil fuels. In many factories coal-fired boilers are still used to generate steam and hot water used in dyeing and finishing. While the UN Fashion Charter on Climate Change simply commits brands to stop adding new coal boilers by 2025, few companies find this commitment meaningful. Leading brands are now moving to phase out existing thermal coal in major supplier facilities.</p>\r
\r
\r
<ul><li>Asics is the only company to report that it has eliminated onsite coal burning at all of its Tier 1 supplier facilities.<span class=footnote><sup>[2]</sup></span></li>\r
<li>Mammut committed to phase out coal use in its supply chain by 2030.</li>\r
<li>PUMA committed to replace all coal-fired boilers at PUMA\u2019s core suppliers, which includes both Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers.</li>\r
<li>Nike has worked with suppliers across more than 40 facilities to replace thermal fossil fuel boiler systems with electrified boilers over the past six years, enabling further decarbonization through the purchase of renewable electricity, and has eliminated the direct use of coal in all footwear manufacturing.<span class=footnote><sup>[3]</sup></span></li>\r
<li>Adidas and Esprit also indicated that they are working with supply chain partners to replace coal-fired boilers.</li></ul>\r
\r
\r
<h4>Assessing Supply Chain Renewable Electricity Strategy </h4>\r
<p>A company whose strategy focuses on maximizing impact and changing the grid over the long term can serve as a powerful catalyst in driving investment in renewable generation, as well as moving both utilities and policymakers to prioritize bringing more renewable energy onto the grid. But some companies are simply seeking to secure the ability to claim a renewable energy supply, but not actually changing the mix of the electricity on the grid that are powering their operations or supply chains. High-impact strategies will include strong incentives for suppliers to focus on securing a renewable electricity supply that is local, additional, and from sustainable sources.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>An increasing number of brands are building supplier decision-making capacity on renewable energy options for their factories, either directly or through collaborative programs such as those run by the Apparel Impact Institute. But with payback times on site renewables generally longer than energy efficiency investments, and renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs) typically much longer than supplier contracts, apparel brands need to provide financial or contractual incentives to show greater partnership to accelerate the deployment of renewables among key suppliers and to increase confidence that brands\u2019 decisions on supply chain contracts will become dependent on suppliers having access to renewable electricity. </p>\r
\r
\r
<p><strong>Highlights of Strategies to Incentivize Renewable Apparel Manufacturing:</strong></p>\r
\r
\r
<p><strong><i>Requiring GHG Reduction Targets and Reporting of Facility Energy Performance</i></strong></p>\r
<ul><li>Asics requires strategic Tier 1 suppliers to set emissions targets and strategic Tier 1 and some Tier 2 suppliers to share their emissions data using the SAC's Higg Index.</li></ul>\r
\r
\r
<p><strong><i>Power Purchase Agreements</i></strong></p>\r
<ul><li>Mammut\u2019s supplier secured a renewable power purchase agreement that resulted in 60% reduction in GHG from manufacturing processes for core products.</li></ul>\r
\r
\r
<p><strong><i>Rooftop Solar Deployment</i></strong></p>\r
<ul><li>Nike launched a new factory rooftop solar photovoltaic deployment program, with particular focus on China, Vietnam and Indonesia.</li>\r
<li>Adidas provided technical expertise for solar rooftop feasibility studies in key sourcing countries covering approximately 80% of strategic suppliers, resulting in 27 MW of rooftop solar to date.</li></ul>\r
\r
\r
<p><strong><i>Shifting Supply Chain to Electricity Grids with More Renewables</i></strong></p>\r
<ul><li>As part of Mammut\u2019s 2030 Net Zero strategy, the company is shifting its supply chain to regions with high levels of renewable energy, including an additional 10% of their supply chain to Europe.</li></ul>\r
\r
\r
<p>The lack of reporting of underlying energy demand or scale of manufacturing capacity connected with supply chain renewable energy projects, at a factory, supplier or even regional level remains a fundamental problem for assessing the impact of company efforts to transition their production of their products to renewable energy. Even among those companies who have taken some steps to deploy rooftop solar or other renewable energy projects in partnership with suppliers, the numerator amount of renewable energy is reported, but not the denominator energy context that would show whether the project is significant to the brand or the supplier. </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Companies and suppliers that are serious about transitioning their supply chain to renewable energy sources will provide the energy demand and share of manufacturing capacity alongside details of the size and technology used in renewable energy projects, and provide regular updates on their progress at a country level (or regional level for larger countries). </p>`,be=`<ol><li>International Renewable Energy Agency.

</ol>`,we="Renewable Energy Advocacy",ve=`<p>Increasing access to renewable energy in supply chain countries is shaped by government policy decisions that may stifle or accelerate renewable energy deployment. Without supportive policy frameworks and political will, fashion companies will find it increasingly difficult to curb their climate pollution. Particularly in countries that lack basic access to scalable renewable electricity supply, advocating for policy changes must be central to the overall strategy for successfully shifting manufacturing from coal to clean energy. When many companies within one sector work together to leverage their contractual power, they can trigger the large-scale change needed to decarbonize the grid and stop new fossil fuel investments.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Despite the lack of progress deploying renewables within the supply chain, advocacy opposing new investment in coal fired electricity was an important bright spot. The fashion sector has illuminated the impact of collective advocacy recently with several powerful examples, including a 2020 letter to Cambodia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Aun Pornmoniroth, cautioning that the country's plans to increase coal-fired power would jeopardize future orders from the signatory brands.<span class=footnote><sup>[1]</sup></span> Facing a dramatic expansion of coal electricity generation in Vietnam and the lack of options for companies to purchase a renewable energy supply, more than 20 footwear and apparel brands penned a letter to the Vietnamese Prime Minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, seeking the implementation of a long-awaited pilot program that would enable the purchase of renewables via a direct power purchase agreement (DPPA).<span class=footnote><sup>[2]</sup></span> </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Other examples of advocacy leadership recognized in this year\u2019s scorecard include efforts to urge governments to set strong climate targets, in support of the Paris Accord, such as the letter from businesses and investors urging the EU to adopt a 2030 climate target mandating 55% GHG emissions reductions,<span class=footnote><sup>[3]</sup></span> and a similar letter in the US.<span class=footnote><sup>[4]</sup></span> Examples of advocacy that were given less credit, but are still important to the sector\u2019s efforts to align with the Paris Accord, include the 2019 United for the Paris Agreement letter from unions and CEOs,<span class=footnote><sup>[5]</sup></span> the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance call for the US federal government to transition to zero-carbon energy,<span class=footnote><sup>[6]</sup></span> the U.N. Business Ambition for 1.5\u2103 commitment,<span class=footnote><sup>[7]</sup></span> and an amicus brief in support of the US EPA Clean Power Plan.<span class=footnote><sup>[8]</sup></span></p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Despite important leadership by several brands, the average grade across all brands for the impact area Renewable Energy Advocacy is an underwhelming \u201CD+\u201D. A direct line runs between the overwhelming dearth of advocacy leadership in this analysis and the lack of meaningful performance in shifting supply chains onto renewable energy. The fashion sector must ratchet up its collaborative advocacy efforts working with peer brands and with contracted suppliers to increase access the renewable energy it so clearly needs if companies are to scale the deployment of renewable energy in their supply chain, which is critical to phase out coal and the achieve the decarbonization of the electricity grid needed to put the sector on a 1.5\u2103 pathway and prevent the tremendous health impacts associated with the burning of fossil fuels.</p>`,ke=`<ol><li>VOA Cambodia.

</li></ol>`,_e="Low-Carbon and Longer Lasting Materials",Ae=`<p>In addition to replacing fossil fuel sources of energy in the manufacturing of apparel, breaking away from energy intensive synthetic materials produced from fossil fuels must also become a core tenet of any meaningful climate strategy for global fashion brands. The shift to energy intensive synthetic materials like polyester and nylon has been a central driver in the fashion\u2019s sector\u2019s rapid increase in GHG emissions, enabling the fast fashion business model that feeds rapid consumption and enormous waste throughout the production cycle that is clearly unsustainable and incompatible with addressing climate change. Consumer surveys and industry insiders have repeatedly signaled that the fast fashion model does not have a place in a post-pandemic world,<span class=footnote><sup>[1]</sup></span> strengthening the business case for fashion leaders to move materials away from polyester and other synthetic materials driving fossil fuel extraction, pollution, and high levels of waste.</p>\r
\r
\r
<h3>Fossil Fuel Synthetics</h3>\r
\r
\r
<p>The most important marker of leadership in the area of materials in the Scorecard is demonstrating meaningful commitments and efforts to reduce the reliance on high-carbon fossil fuel synthetics such as fracked polyester (see Fashion\u2019s Fossil Fuel Problem). While many brands have explicit commitments or indicated the desire to switch to more \u201Csustainable\u201D fabrics, a closer look at brand sustainability strategies illustrates that very few companies are in fact moving in the right direction in addressing the fossil fuel based synthetics and fracked fabrics.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Communicating to consumers and investors that sourcing recycled plastic from other waste streams is \u201Csustainable\u201D effectively amounts to greenwashing. This is due to several factors:</p>\r
<ul><li>Relying on recycled fiber content from sources such as disposable plastic bottles or ocean plastic waste risks increasing demand for virgin fossil fuel feedstocks and polluting throwaway plastic products.</li>\r
<li>Such recycled polyester and nylon items are most often used only once and become destined to be landfilled or incinerated, and until then will continue to emit countless microfibers into our oceans.</li>\r
<li>Unless textiles and apparel generated by the fashion sector become the source of the recycled content feedstocks, brands are essentially perpetuating the problematic linear take-make-dispose system, which would further exacerbate the sector\u2019s waste and climate pollution problem.</li></ul>\r
\r
\r
<p>Leading sportswear and outdoor brands including adidas, Arc\u2019teryx, Gap (Athleta), Columbia, Lululemon, MEC, New Balance, Patagonia, REI and Under Armour received an \u201CF\u201D grade on their materials in large part because of their lack of meaningful or any progress in setting targets to phase out fossil fuel synthetics and replace them with plant-based materials or recycled materials generated using closed-loop recycling that relies on discarded apparel and textiles. Many of these brands are doubling down on their use of fossil fuel fabrics by sourcing fibers recycled from single-use plastic bottles or other waste such as fishing nets, and making false sustainability claims in the process.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>The following brands are leading the sector with their efforts to eliminate fossil fuel based synthetics from their material mix:</p>\r
<ul><li>VF Corp.\u2019s outdoor brand, Icebreaker, is the only brand to commit to phasing out all fossil synthetics, including recycled, from all of their product lines by 2023.</li>\r
<li>Allbirds has set a good example for footwear brands to follow by largely replacing fossil synthetics typically used in shoes with renewable and bio-based materials.</li>\r
<li>Eileen Fisher, Kering, and Levi\u2019s use a small percentage of fossil fuel synthetics in their entire fiber mix (less than 8%, 4% and 9%, respectively).</li>\r
<li>Mammut successfully closed the recycling loop for one of its key and most energy-intensive products, climbing ropes. The company reports it works with Econyl, a nylon recycler, to recycle used ropes sold and collected by Mammut. Emissions associated with producing ropes constitute 13% of Mammut\u2019s annual carbon footprint. The outdoor brand intends to expand closed-loop recycling of nylon-based products to its apparel and packs.</li></ul>\r
\r
\r
<p>Beyond efforts to phase out fossil fuel fabrics, brands that scored highly in the area of materials have also taken steps to ensure a shift to low-carbon plant- or animal-based fibers such as organic or regenerative cotton, leather, and viscose or other wood-derived materials that are verified to be of low deforestation risk.<span class=footnote><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>\r
\r
\r
<h3>Cotton</h3>\r
\r
\r
<p>Cotton is the second most widely used material by the fashion industry after polyester. While cotton generally requires less energy to produce compared to polyester or other synthetics, conventionally grown cotton is associated with a greater carbon footprint, significant toxic pesticide use and labor rights concerns compared to organic or regenerative cotton.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Growing pressure by consumers on brands to source more sustainable cotton led to the emergence of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), an industry-led initiative that sets certain ecological and labor parameters for growing cotton. However, independent analysis by the Changing Markets Foundation shows that BCI may have perpetuated the use of genetically modified cotton seeds and consequently continued dependence on toxic pesticide products that pose serious risk to human health and the environment.<span class=footnote><sup>[3]</sup></span></p>\r
<blockquote>\r
<p><strong>Organic cotton vs. BCI</strong></p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Many brands that have set targets to source \u201Csustainable\u201D cotton are claiming progress toward meeting their targets by sourcing BCI cotton. This is a troubling trend in the fashion sector as BCI is associated with higher carbon emissions compared to organic or regenerative cotton and may pose serious environmental risks due to heavy dependence on harmful pesticides. One study of cotton farming in Maharashtra, India, shows BCI cotton has a Global Warming Potential lower than conventional cotton, but higher than that of organic cotton (435 to 731 and 295, respectively, per ton of seed cotton).<span class=footnote><sup>[4]</sup></span> Increasing demand for BCI may adversely impact the growth of organic cotton farming, making it more challenging for brands that want to switch source organic cotton. Nearly a third of the companies evaluated in the Scorecard have made commitments to source 100% organic cotton or have reached that goal. Other brands need to follow suit and work with suppliers and farmers to further drive the supply of organic or regenerative cotton.</p>\r
	</blockquote>\r
<h3>Materials and Deforestation</h3>\r
\r
\r
<p>Conventional wood-based (or cellulosic) materials such as viscose and rayon can have a high carbon footprint as well as adverse impacts on biodiversity if sourced from practices that contribute to deforestation. The increasing availability of alternative cellulosic fibers that are sourced from sustainably managed forests such as TENCEL provides an opportunity for fashion brands to eliminate raw materials that may be driving deforestation, especially in sensitive ecosystems such as the Amazon or the boreal forest in North America. Yet many brands have not taken any steps to ensure their fabrics are not linked to deforestation. </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Of the 47 brands evaluated in the Scorecard, 19 brands (40%) did not have deforestation policies with respect to wood-based fibers such as viscose. These brands included leading sportswear and outdoor brands adidas, Arc\u2019teryx, Asics, Columbia, MEC, Pentland, PUMA and the North Face (a subsidiary of VF Corp.) and the vast majority of luxury brands including Armani, Capri Holdings, Chanel, Kering, Prada and Salvatore Ferragamo. While some fast fashion brands have taken steps to source cellulosic fibers verified to have a low deforestation risk, Boohoo and UNIQLO have not put in place policies or guidelines for sourcing sustainable viscose or other cellulosic fibers.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Sportswear, luxury and footwear brands such as ALDO face significant risk with respect to deforestation due to their reliance on animal-based leather as a primary raw material used for shoes, purses, luxury apparel and other accessories. Cattle ranching is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation globally, and leather makes up an important part of the business model that promotes the continued expansion of cattle ranching in the Amazon biome. Brands need to develop strong policies that prevent the sourcing of both wood-based materials and leather linked to deforestation. </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Marks & Spencer\u2019s (M&S) policy on leather, which requires suppliers to \u201Cannually disclose the country of slaughter of all our leather\u201D and \u201Cexclude leather from cattle reared in the Amazon biome from [its] supply chains,\u201D among other considerations, stands out as a good model for brands to follow in developing their deforestation policies.<span class=footnote><sup>[5]</sup></span></p>`,Ce=`<ol><li>McKinsey & Company, The State of Fashion 2020, Coronavirus Update (2020), also Weaving a Better Future: Rebuilding a More Sustainable Fashion Industry After COVID-19, https://apparelcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Weaving-a-Better-Future-Covid-19-BCG-SAC-Higg-Co-Report.pdf</li>\r

</ol>`,Ge="Greener Shipping",Fe=`<p>Global apparel brands have built their business model to be heavily dependent on the global shipping infrastructure of air and marine cargo shipping operators, which are currently 100% powered with fossil fuels. Emissions from marine shipping alone are currently estimated to be approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and on track to be as much as 17% by 2050 if left unregulated. Ship-based emissions from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, where clothing and shoes combined were the largest portion of marine cargo traffic in 2019, will soon be the largest source of smog-forming emissions in Southern California, disproportionately impacting lower income and communities of color surrounding the port.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Despite its significant environmental impact and central role shipping plays in executing the business model of major apparel brands, reducing shipping pollution receives relatively little attention in the climate and sustainability strategies of most apparel brands, and has been dismissed by some brands as not being a priority. While shipping may represent a much smaller piece of a typical fashion brand's supply chain emissions, shipping related GHG emissions are often in fact much larger than the scope 1 and 2 climate pollution from their own operations that are typically central to their climate targets and solutions initiatives.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>While 32 of 47 brands in the Scorecard report shipping related GHG emissions, only 18 (38%) of the brands included shipping in their scope 3 supply chain emissions reduction target. </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Key strategies for fashion brands to adopt to tackle shipping related climate pollution:</p>\r
<h4>Slower Shipping + Cleaner Fuels </h4>\r
<p>Several brands claim to have set a preference to transition more of their product logistics from air shipping to (lower cost) ocean cargo freight, but stronger customer demand for cleaner fuels and ships is something that most apparel brands could do to provide the signal to global shipping companies to focus on reducing their emissions. A number of brands have committed broadly to shift more of cargo from air to marine shipping as part of their supply chain strategy, and Esprit and Mammut both setting specific 2030 reduction targets for shipping related GHG emissions.</p>\r
\r
\r
<h4>Creating Demand for Zero Emission Vessels + Phase Out Fossil Fueled Shipping</h4>\r
<p>With apparel and textile representing one of the largest segments of containerized cargo shipping, global fashion brands have a huge opportunity to create the market demand needed for the deployment of Zero Emission Vessels (ZEVs), and avoid the wasted investment in both LNG ships and \u201CScrubbers\u201D that are being installed to continue the reliance on highly toxic HFO (see scrubbers below). </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Lower emission maritime shipping options, including hybrid sailing cargo vessels and zero-emission technology pathways using renewably produced ammonia and hydrogen have already begun to emerge, but strong demand from major shipping customers is recognized as critical to trigger the investment needed for a rapid shift away from fossil fuels like HFO to low and zero-carbon cargo vessels in the coming 5-10 years. By committing to relying exclusively on ZEV cargo shipping no later than 2030, fashion brands can play a major role in catalyzing the necessary investment in vessels and port infrastructure that will enable a deep decarbonization of shipping. Mammut has recently emerged as the first apparel brand to establish a commitment to 100% ZEV by 2030.</p>\r
\r
\r
<h4>Wrong Turn: LNG </h4>\r
<p>Investments in LNG-powered ships have been pursued at a limited but growing scale among cargo ship operators seeking to claim they have moved off of highly polluting HFO bunker fuels, and then presented to customers as a way to reduce shipping-related pollution. However, while LNG has the potential to significantly reduce sulfur related emissions compared to HFO, recent studies have shown that due to \u201Cmethane slip\u201D in LNG-powered engines, LNG ships produce even more GHG emissions than those powered by HFO. In addition to higher GHG emissions, much like the LNG solutions being considered on land for electricity generation, LNG powered shipping would require massive investments in new ships and port infrastructure for bunkering, which not only fails to deliver on the need for zero-emission, fossil-free shipping, it would drive higher emissions and higher costs from stranded assets once real pathways to decarbonized shipping are pursued.</p>\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
<h4>Wrong Turn: HFO \u201CScrubbers\u201D</h4>\r
<p>Rather than shifting to cleaner marine fuels to comply with the IMO\u2019s 2020 low sulfur standard, a number of global shipping companies have chosen instead to use the \u201Cscrubber loophole\u201D to comply with the new regulation. This loophole allows shipping companies to continue to use highly toxic HFO bunker fuel to power ships, as long as the ships install scrubbers to remove sulfur from the exhaust, in essence simply converting air pollution into water pollution as the scrubber wastewater is discharged. This dumping of scrubber waste adds dangerous heavy metals to the water, while also significantly contributing to the acidification of the ocean that is already underway due to climate change. Fashion brands should insist their carriers rapidly transition away from HFO and fuel oil blends, selecting only those shipping companies and freight forwarders with ships that have converted to MGO or cleaner fuels, and avoiding those companies relying on scrubbers as a false solution.        </p>`,xe="Methodology",Se=`<p>The Fossil Free Fashion Scorecard was developed by Stand.earth and analyzes 47 leading apparel and footwear companies on their commitments and actions to reduce climate pollution in line with a 1.5emissions pathway identified in the Paris Climate Accord. The Fossil Free Fashion Scorecard expands upon the company analysis of Stand.earth\u2019s Filthy Fashion Climate Scorecard, released in October of 2019, focusing greater attention on company efforts to eliminate fossil fuels from critical areas of their value chain and drive the deployment and use of renewable energy.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Companies were evaluated on 15 criteria, comprising five issue areas: 1.5\xB0C aligned climate commitments and supply chain energy transparency; renewable and energy efficient manufacturing; renewable energy advocacy; low carbon and longer lasting materials; and greener shipping. To evaluate performance, Stand analysts used publicly available sources such as sustainability and annual reports, submissions to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), company websites and social media accounts, and media and press releases.</p>\r
\r
\r
<p>All companies were sent the criteria used for evaluation and invited to dialogue with Stand.earth leading up to the completion of the Scorecard. Following the initial scoring, Stand.earth shared draft score and assessment details with all companies a month or more prior to the publication of the scorecard, with an invitation to provide feedback, disclose additional information or publicize new policies or actions. Lastly, evaluations were finalized and corresponding letter grades assigned for each of the five issue areas as well as for an overall total grade, along an F to A+ grade scale, with A+ being the highest possible score and F being the lowest. For the overall company grade, impact areas were weighted as follows:</p>\r
<ul><li>1.5\u2103 aligned climate commitments and supply chain energy transparency: 25%</li>\r
<li>Renewable and energy-efficient manufacturing: 35%</li>\r
<li>Renewable energy advocacy: 15%</li>\r
<li>Low carbon and longer-lasting materials: 15%</li>\r
<li>Greener shipping: 10%</li></ul>\r
\r
\r
<h3>Scoring criteria</h3>\r
\r
\r
<h4>1. 1.5\xB0C aligned climate commitments and supply chain energy transparency</h4>\r
\r
\r
<p>Companies were evaluated on the strength of their commitments to reduce GHG emissions across their entire value chains in line with a 1.5\u2103 pathway, and the level of detail made publicly available on energy consumption and GHG emissions. </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>Companies exhibiting climate leadership will accordingly have set climate targets in all scopes, with a minimum ambition of 55% GHG emissions reductions from 2018 or later levels by 2030, especially when it comes to supply chain emissions. While leadership in the sector with respect to emission reduction targets for scopes 1 and 2 is inching toward 100% reduction, renewable energy targets and sourcing strategies must not rely on unbundled Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), but must ensure the renewable energy purchased is both connected to demand and additional to the grid.</p> \r
\r
\r
<p>Meaningful leadership in transparency encompasses publicly reporting the list of factories and suppliers in all tiers, the GHG emissions from a company\u2019s entire value chain, the energy demand and renewable energy used, and the specific attributes of that renewable energy, also from the entire value chain. </p>\r
\r
\r
<h4>2. Renewable energy and energy-efficient manufacturing</h4>\r
\r
\r
<p>Companies are assessed on their efforts to incentivize, including through financial means, energy efficiency measures in manufacturing facilities at all supply chain tiers as well as the deployment and procurement of renewable energy in these facilities. Leadership in this area can be exemplified by demonstrated progress in phasing out coal-fired water boilers, investments in deploying renewable energy projects such as rooftop solar, and demonstrated reduction in energy demand due to investments in measures to increase efficiency or renewables. </p>\r
\r
\r
<p>The Scorecard also evaluates company efforts to require supply chain partners to set GHG emissions reduction targets, provide facility level data via the Higg Index, and publicly report GHG emissions annually.</p>\r
\r
\r
<h4>3. Renewable energy advocacy</h4>\r
\r
\r
<p>Companies were evaluated on their efforts over the preceding 24 months to urge policymakers, especially in supply chain countries, to increase factory access to renewable energy and remove barriers that stifle the clean energy transformation needed for the fashion sector to align entire value chains with the 1.5\u2103 pathway. Advocacy by fashion brands in support of stronger global, regional and national GHG targets was also considered and recognized in the Scorecard.</p>\r
\r
\r
<h4>4. Low carbon and longer-lasting materials</h4>\r
\r
\r
<p>Companies are assessed on their ambition, policies and actions to decarbonize their materials.. Specifically, the Scorecard evaluated company commitments and progress on:</p>\r
<ul><li>Reducing reliance on fossil fuel based materials by phasing out all fibers such as polyester and nylon by 2030, starting with virgin fibers as an intermediate goal. </li>\r
<li>Increasing the use of organic or regenerative cotton.</li>\r
<li>Eliminating the use of wood-based materials such as viscose as well as leather linked to deforestation, especially in sensitive ecosystems such as the Amazon biome.</li>\r
<li>Increasing recycled content in products and closing the apparel-to-apparel recycling loop.</li>\r
<li>Improving product durability and repairability, adopting resale models to move toward longer-lasting products.</li>\r
<li>Disclosure of material and fiber mix as well as volumes of deadstock, and actions to reduce deadstock.</li></ul>\r
\r
\r
<h4>5. Greener shipping </h4>\r
\r
\r
<p>Companies were evaluated on the strength of their strategies and measurable progress toward reducing GHG and other pollution associated with the shipment of products, prior to the point of sale, via marine and air cargo. High-scoring companies will demonstrate:</p>\r
\r
\r
<ul><li>Commitment to zero emissions vessels (ZEV) by 2030.</li>\r
<li>Adoption of explicit targets for reducing shipping-related GHG emissions by 2030, or inclusion of shipping emissions in broader scope 3 2030 GHG target.</li>\r
<li>Annual reporting of emissions from upstream shipping, including a breakdown between air and marine cargo shipments. </li>\r
<li>Evidence of progress in reducing shipping-related emissions through slower shipping modes, use of cleaner fuels, or shortening of supply chains.</li>\r
<li>Public support for government policies to reduce shipping-related pollution, discourage the switch to liquified natural gas (LNG) fuel, and support the deployment of ZEV vessels and port infrastructure.</li></ul>`;var q={"1":[],"2":[],"3":[],"4":[],"5":[],"6":[],"7":[],kf1_title:oe,kf1_intro:se,kf1_body_1:re,kf1_body_2:le,kf1_body_3:ce,kf1_notes:pe,kf2_title:de,kf2_body_1:he,kf2_body_2:ue,kf2_body_3:me,kf2_notes:ge,kf3_title:fe,kf3_body_1:ye,kf3_notes:be,kf4_title:we,kf4_body_1:ve,kf4_notes:ke,kf5_title:_e,kf5_body_1:Ae,kf5_notes:Ce,kf6_title:Ge,kf6_body_1:Fe,methodology_title:xe,methodology_body_1:Se};function Ee(m){let t,o=q.methodology_body_1+"",e;return{c(){t=new ne,e=j(),this.h()},l(a){t=te(a),e=j(),this.h()},h(){t.a=e},m(a,l){t.m(o,a,l),u(a,e,l)},p:ae,d(a){a&&i(e),a&&t.d()}}}function Ie(m){let t,o;return t=new ee({props:{sm:"12",lg:{size:8,offset:2},$$slots:{default:[Ee]},$$scope:{ctx:m}}}),{c(){I(t.$$.fragment)},l(e){T(t.$$.fragment,e)},m(e,a){P(t,e,a),o=!0},p(e,a){const l={};a&1&&(l.$$scope={dirty:a,ctx:e}),t.$set(l)},i(e){o||(H(t.$$.fragment,e),o=!0)},o(e){M(t.$$.fragment,e),o=!1},d(e){R(t,e)}}}function Te(m){let t,o;return t=new Y({props:{$$slots:{default:[Ie]},$$scope:{ctx:m}}}),{c(){I(t.$$.fragment)},l(e){T(t.$$.fragment,e)},m(e,a){P(t,e,a),o=!0},p(e,a){const l={};a&1&&(l.$$scope={dirty:a,ctx:e}),t.$set(l)},i(e){o||(H(t.$$.fragment,e),o=!0)},o(e){M(t.$$.fragment,e),o=!1},d(e){R(t,e)}}}function Pe(m){let t,o,e,a,l,g,C,f,w,$,G,y,v,k,N=q.methodology_title+"",V,F,b,h,x;return g=new ie({props:{headerColor:"blue"}}),h=new X({props:{$$slots:{default:[Te]},$$scope:{ctx:m}}}),{c(){t=c("meta"),o=c("meta"),e=c("meta"),a=c("meta"),l=S(),I(g.$$.fragment),C=S(),f=c("div"),w=c("span"),$=O("Fossil-free Fashion Scorecard"),G=S(),y=c("div"),v=c("div"),k=c("h1"),V=O(N),F=S(),b=c("div"),I(h.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(n){const s=K('[data-svelte="svelte-bh1oxh"]',document.head);t=p(s,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),o=p(s,"META",{property:!0,content:!0}),e=p(s,"META",{property:!0,content:!0}),a=p(s,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),s.forEach(i),l=E(n),T(g.$$.fragment,n),C=E(n),f=p(n,"DIV",{class:!0});var A=_(f);w=p(A,"SPAN",{class:!0});var B=_(w);$=U(B,"Fossil-free Fashion Scorecard"),B.forEach(i),A.forEach(i),G=E(n),y=p(n,"DIV",{class:!0});var W=_(y);v=p(W,"DIV",{class:!0});var z=_(v);k=p(z,"H1",{class:!0});var L=_(k);V=U(L,N),L.forEach(i),z.forEach(i),W.forEach(i),F=E(n),b=p(n,"DIV",{class:!0});var D=_(b);T(h.$$.fragment,D),D.forEach(i),this.h()},h(){r(t,"name","title"),r(t,"content","Methodology | Fossil-free Fashion Scorecard | Stand.earth"),r(o,"property","og:title"),r(o,"content","Fossil-free Fashion Scorecard | Stand.earth"),r(e,"property","og:description"),r(e,"content","As one of the biggest drivers of climate pollution, fashion companies must move decisively to break their dependence on fossil fuels, spurring the rapid transition to renewable energy and fossil free fabrics we need to safeguard a livable future."),r(a,"name","description"),r(a,"content","As one of the biggest drivers of climate pollution, fashion companies must move decisively to break their dependence on fossil fuels, spurring the rapid transition to renewable energy and fossil free fabrics we need to safeguard a livable future."),r(w,"class","svelte-1nv3py4"),r(f,"class","banner svelte-1nv3py4"),r(k,"class","svelte-1nv3py4"),r(v,"class","overlay svelte-1nv3py4"),r(y,"class","cover svelte-1nv3py4"),r(b,"class","content svelte-1nv3py4")},m(n,s){d(document.head,t),d(document.head,o),d(document.head,e),d(document.head,a),u(n,l,s),P(g,n,s),u(n,C,s),u(n,f,s),d(f,w),d(w,$),u(n,G,s),u(n,y,s),d(y,v),d(v,k),d(k,V),u(n,F,s),u(n,b,s),P(h,b,null),x=!0},p(n,[s]){const A={};s&1&&(A.$$scope={dirty:s,ctx:n}),h.$set(A)},i(n){x||(H(g.$$.fragment,n),H(h.$$.fragment,n),x=!0)},o(n){M(g.$$.fragment,n),M(h.$$.fragment,n),x=!1},d(n){i(t),i(o),i(e),i(a),n&&i(l),R(g,n),n&&i(C),n&&i(f),n&&i(G),n&&i(y),n&&i(F),n&&i(b),R(h)}}}class $e extends Z{constructor(t){super();J(this,t,null,Pe,Q,{})}}export{$e as default};
