The Fossil Free Fashion Scorecard expands upon the company analysis of Stand.earth’s Filthy Fashion Climate Scorecard, released in October of 2019, focusing greater attention on company efforts to eliminate fossil fuels from critical areas of their value chain and drive the deployment and use of renewable energy.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Companies were evaluated on 15 criteria, comprising five issue areas: 1.5°C aligned climate commitments and supply chain energy transparency; renewable and energy efficient manufacturing; renewable energy advocacy; low carbon and longer lasting materials; and greener shipping. To evaluate performance, Stand analysts used publicly available sources such as sustainability and annual reports, submissions to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), company websites and social media accounts, and media and press releases.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>All companies were sent the criteria used for evaluation and invited to dialogue with Stand.earth leading up to the completion of the Scorecard. Following the initial scoring, Stand.earth shared draft score and assessment details with all companies a month or more prior to the publication of the scorecard, with an invitation to provide feedback, disclose additional information or publicize new policies or actions. Lastly, evaluations were finalized and corresponding letter grades assigned for each of the five issue areas as well as for an overall total grade, along an F to A+ grade scale, with A+ being the highest possible score and F being the lowest. For the overall company grade, impact areas were weighted as follows:</p>\r\n<ul><li>1.5℃ aligned climate commitments and supply chain energy transparency: 25%</li>\r\n<li>Renewable and energy-efficient manufacturing: 35%</li>\r\n<li>Renewable energy advocacy: 15%</li>\r\n<li>Low carbon and longer-lasting materials: 15%</li>\r\n<li>Greener shipping: 10%</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Scoring criteria</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>1. 1.5°C aligned climate commitments and supply chain energy transparency</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Companies were evaluated on the strength of their commitments to reduce GHG emissions across their entire value chains in line with a 1.5℃ pathway, and the level of detail made publicly available on energy consumption and GHG emissions. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Companies exhibiting climate leadership will accordingly have set climate targets in all scopes, with a minimum ambition of 55% GHG emissions reductions from 2018 or later levels by 2030, especially when it comes to supply chain emissions. While leadership in the sector with respect to emission reduction targets for scopes 1 and 2 is inching toward 100% reduction, renewable energy targets and sourcing strategies must not rely on unbundled Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), but must ensure the renewable energy purchased is both connected to demand and additional to the grid.</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meaningful leadership in transparency encompasses publicly reporting the list of factories and suppliers in all tiers, the GHG emissions from a company’s entire value chain, the energy demand and renewable energy used, and the specific attributes of that renewable energy, also from the entire value chain. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2. Renewable energy and energy-efficient manufacturing</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Companies are assessed on their efforts to incentivize, including through financial means, energy efficiency measures in manufacturing facilities at all supply chain tiers as well as the deployment and procurement of renewable energy in these facilities. Leadership in this area can be exemplified by demonstrated progress in phasing out coal-fired water boilers, investments in deploying renewable energy projects such as rooftop solar, and demonstrated reduction in energy demand due to investments in measures to increase efficiency or renewables. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Scorecard also evaluates company efforts to require supply chain partners to set GHG emissions reduction targets, provide facility level data via the Higg Index, and publicly report GHG emissions annually.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3. Renewable energy advocacy</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Companies were evaluated on their efforts over the preceding 24 months to urge policymakers, especially in supply chain countries, to increase factory access to renewable energy and remove barriers that stifle the clean energy transformation needed for the fashion sector to align entire value chains with the 1.5℃ pathway. Advocacy by fashion brands in support of stronger global, regional and national GHG targets was also considered and recognized in the Scorecard.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>4. Low carbon and longer-lasting materials</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Companies are assessed on their ambition, policies and actions to decarbonize their materials.. Specifically, the Scorecard evaluated company commitments and progress on:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Reducing reliance on fossil fuel based materials by phasing out all fibers such as polyester and nylon by 2030, starting with virgin fibers as an intermediate goal. </li>\r\n<li>Increasing the use of organic or regenerative cotton.</li>\r\n<li>Eliminating the use of wood-based materials such as viscose as well as leather linked to deforestation, especially in sensitive ecosystems such as the Amazon biome.</li>\r\n<li>Increasing recycled content in products and closing the apparel-to-apparel recycling loop.</li>\r\n<li>Improving product durability and repairability, adopting resale models to move toward longer-lasting products.</li>\r\n<li>Disclosure of material and fiber mix as well as volumes of deadstock, and actions to reduce deadstock.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5. Greener shipping </h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Companies were evaluated on the strength of their strategies and measurable progress toward reducing GHG and other pollution associated with the shipment of products, prior to the point of sale, via marine and air cargo. High-scoring companies will demonstrate:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Commitment to zero emissions vessels (ZEV) by 2030.</li>\r\n<li>Adoption of explicit targets for reducing shipping-related GHG emissions by 2030, or inclusion of shipping emissions in broader scope 3 2030 GHG target.</li>\r\n<li>Annual reporting of emissions from upstream shipping, including a breakdown between air and marine cargo shipments. </li>\r\n<li>Evidence of progress in reducing shipping-related emissions through slower shipping modes, use of cleaner fuels, or shortening of supply chains.</li>\r\n<li>Public support for government policies to reduce shipping-related pollution, discourage the switch to liquified natural gas (LNG) fuel, and support the deployment of ZEV vessels and port infrastructure.</li></ul>";function j(e){let n,a,r=E+"";return{c(){n=new F,a=S(),this.h()},l(e){n=C(e),a=S(),this.h()},h(){n.a=a},m(e,i){n.m(r,e,i),f(e,a,i)},p:k,d(e){e&&m(a),e&&n.d()}}}function z(e){let n,a;return n=new G({props:{sm:"12",lg:{size:8,offset:2},$$slots:{default:[j]},$$scope:{ctx:e}}}),{c(){i(n.$$.fragment)},l(e){l(n.$$.fragment,e)},m(e,r){g(n,e,r),a=!0},p(e,a){const r={};1&a&&(r.$$scope={dirty:a,ctx:e}),n.$set(r)},i(e){a||(w(n.$$.fragment,e),a=!0)},o(e){b(n.$$.fragment,e),a=!1},d(e){v(n,e)}}}function A(e){let n,a;return n=new $({props:{$$slots:{default:[z]},$$scope:{ctx:e}}}),{c(){i(n.$$.fragment)},l(e){l(n.$$.fragment,e)},m(e,r){g(n,e,r),a=!0},p(e,a){const r={};1&a&&(r.$$scope={dirty:a,ctx:e}),n.$set(r)},i(e){a||(w(n.$$.fragment,e),a=!0)},o(e){b(n.$$.fragment,e),a=!1},d(e){v(n,e)}}}function I(e){let n,a,$,G,S,C,k,F,E,j,z,I,R,D,L=x+"";return n=new H({props:{headerColor:"blue"}}),R=new r({props:{$$slots:{default:[A]},$$scope:{ctx:e}}}),{c(){i(n.$$.fragment),a=s(),$=t("div"),G=t("span"),S=o("Fossil-free Fashion Scorecard"),C=s(),k=t("div"),F=t("div"),E=t("h1"),j=o(L),z=s(),I=t("div"),i(R.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(e){l(n.$$.fragment,e),a=c(e),$=d(e,"DIV",{class:!0});var r=p($);G=d(r,"SPAN",{class:!0});var i=p(G);S=h(i,"Fossil-free Fashion Scorecard"),i.forEach(m),r.forEach(m),C=c(e),k=d(e,"DIV",{class:!0});var s=p(k);F=d(s,"DIV",{class:!0});var t=p(F);E=d(t,"H1",{class:!0});var o=p(E);j=h(o,L),o.forEach(m),t.forEach(m),s.forEach(m),z=c(e),I=d(e,"DIV",{class:!0});var u=p(I);l(R.$$.fragment,u),u.forEach(m),this.h()},h(){u(G,"class","svelte-tjewk1"),u($,"class","banner svelte-tjewk1"),u(E,"class","svelte-tjewk1"),u(F,"class","overlay svelte-tjewk1"),u(k,"class","cover svelte-tjewk1"),u(I,"class","content svelte-tjewk1")},m(e,r){g(n,e,r),f(e,a,r),f(e,$,r),y($,G),y(G,S),f(e,C,r),f(e,k,r),y(k,F),y(F,E),y(E,j),f(e,z,r),f(e,I,r),g(R,I,null),D=!0},p(e,[n]){const a={};1&n&&(a.$$scope={dirty:n,ctx:e}),R.$set(a)},i(e){D||(w(n.$$.fragment,e),w(R.$$.fragment,e),D=!0)},o(e){b(n.$$.fragment,e),b(R.$$.fragment,e),D=!1},d(e){v(n,e),e&&m(a),e&&m($),e&&m(C),e&&m(k),e&&m(z),e&&m(I),v(R)}}}export default class extends e{constructor(e){super(),n(this,e,null,I,a,{})}}
