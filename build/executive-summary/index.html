<div class="section section-1 svelte-8abvrp"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2"><div id="s2copy"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>In the wake of a global pandemic that reinforced growing public demand for strong action to curb the climate crisis and protect public health, fashion brands are at a critical crossroads. As people around the world call for a just and green economic recovery, the fashion industry, which is responsible for 5 to 8% of all global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, must quickly ramp up its efforts to eliminate fossil fuels across supply chains in order to halve its emissions by 2030 in line with the Paris Accord.<span class=footnote><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>


<p>The fashion industry continues to rely heavily on coal to power the manufacturing of its products, contributing to rising climate emissions and deadly air pollution in countries, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, where its supply chain is concentrated. Fashion brands are also driving demand for fracked fibers such as polyester, which are derived from fossil fuel feedstocks, and whose production is associated with significantly greater emissions compared to plant-based fabrics such as cotton.
</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
			<!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>Over the last few years, many fashion brands have pledged to take steps to cut the climate emissions generated from their supply chains by signing the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, which commits brands to 30% emission reduction across entire value chains.<span class=footnote><sup>[2]</sup></span> But as the runway to 2030 gets shorter, fashion brands must move rapidly from climate commitments to actions geared to phase out fossil fuels in order to halve their greenhouse gas emissions in this decade in line with limiting global warming to 1.5℃. 
</p>


<p>Climate science has made it abundantly clear that the fashion industry’s business-as-usual reliance on fossil fuels to manufacture and ship its garments is not consistent with a climate-safe future. Continued reluctance by fashion brands to decarbonize their manufacturing processes also poses significant reputational and investor risk, with both consumers and shareholders increasingly demanding corporate action to cut down emissions in line with the Paris Accord.<span class=footnote><sup>[3]</sup></span></p>


<p>Stand.earth’s Fossil-Free Fashion Scorecard benchmarks 47 leading fashion and apparel companies on their efforts to eliminate fossil fuels in the manufacturing, raw materials and shipping of their goods. The Scorecard builds on Stand.earth’s Filthy Fashion Climate Scorecard published in 2019 by analyzing not only their climate commitments but also their efforts to increase renewable energy and energy efficiency in manufacturing, shift to low-carbon materials, and reduce climate pollution from shipping. </p><!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

<div style="overflow: hidden;" class="accordion-collapse"><div class="accordion-body"><div class="acc-body"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Several fashion companies have centered their climate strategy on becoming “carbon neutral” or “climate positive”. But in many cases, these increasingly popular buzzwords provide a false impression about companies’ decarbonization efforts. For example, Gap has set a target to become “carbon neutral” by 2050; however, the company’s absolute emissions reduction target of 30% by 2030 for its supply chain remains far below the trajectory it needs to set. Gap has also not set a renewable energy target for its manufacturing, which suggests that the company will likely rely on carbon offsets and unbundled renewable energy credits to claim credit toward achieving its climate goals. Another brand that exemplifies this troubling trend is Ralph Lauren, which has committed to a “net zero” target by 2040 by largely relying on “carbon credits” and “nature-based carbon removal” but has not set a renewable energy target for its manufacturing. Pentland, the parent company of Speedo, has a long-term goal of becoming carbon neutral but no commitments to drive renewable energy in its supply chain. For climate neutrality or positivity goals to be meaningful brands must also commit to halving their emissions throughout the value chain and move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy to power manufacturing. Mammut's new net zero strategy, which promises to reduce absolute emissions 55% and switch to 100% renewable energy in the supply chain, provides a strong model for other brands to follow.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
