{"brand":"SKFK","path":"skfk","subsidiaries":"","category":"casual","grade":"F","summary":"A small brand that bills itself as ethical, SKFK does a decent job giving the appareance of holding a corner of the sustainable fashion market, yet scratching below the surface does not reveal much actual climate leadership. The niche brand's biggest accomplishments are in its material choices, particularly in its ability to source organic cotton and prioritize materials with a lower climate impact. But SKFK's GHG reduction targets are quite low and the company has not shown evidence of shifting its manufacturing onto renewables or encouraging energy efficiency measures with its suppliers.","commitments_grade":"D","commitments_summary":"<h4>Climate commitments</h4><p><strong>In own operations </strong><br/>SKFK has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 35% by 2025 from a 2017 base year but has not set commitments to purchase or switch to renewable energy across all of its own operations.
