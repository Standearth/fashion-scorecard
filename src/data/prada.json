The luxury brand has not explicitly set GHG emissions reduction targets, instead resting on its involvement with the Fashion Pact as de facto target setting, nor has it begun to source renewable energy in its supply chain, where the bulk of its climate pollution is created. Prada is beginning to reduce its reliance on fossil fuel based fabrics with its commitment to source only recycled nylon, a noteworthy first step.","commitments_grade":"D-","commitments_summary":"<h4>Climate commitments</h4><p><strong>In own operations </strong><br/>Prada has not set targets to reduce absolute GHG emissions other than signing the Fashion Pact.
