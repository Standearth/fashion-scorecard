{"brand":"Under Armour","path":"under-armour","grade":"F","summary":"While Under Armour was one of the fastest growing apparel brands prior to COVID-19, Under Armour has lagged far behind many of its athletic apparel peers in responding to climate change. Under Armour adopted SBT-approved reduction targets in April of 2021, but its 30% emissions reduction target in its own operations and supply chain is far below the targets set by leading competitors such as Nike. The company also lags far behind on basic transparency when it comes to disclosing climate emissions and needs to quickly move to phase out coal and drive the deployment and use of renewable energy in its supply chain that is heavily concentrated in Vietnam and China. The company must also take action to phase out fossil fuel materials such as polyester for low carbon alternatives if it’s serious about addressing the climate crisis.","commitments_grade":"F","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Under Armour has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 30% and has set public commitments to switch to 100% renewable energy in its own operations, but it's not clear if the renewable energy will be additional to the grid.
