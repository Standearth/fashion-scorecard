{"brand":"Arc'teryx","path":"arcteryx","grade":"C-","summary":"As a leading North American outdoor gear and apparel brand, Arc'teryx has taken important initial steps in addressing the climate crisis and advocating for meaningful policy solutions. But while the company has set a commitment to reduce GHG emissions in its supply chain, the intensity-based target it has set misses the mark as it does not add up to achieving the 55% absolute emissions reductions consistent with a 1.5 degree pathway. The company has an important opportunity to strengthen its efforts to decarbonize its supply chain by increasing its investment in renewable energy deployment in factories that make its materials and products. The company should improve its transparency on targets related to lower carbon materials and needs to take transparent steps to phase out fossil fuel materials, starting with virgin types.","commitments_grade":"C-","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Arc'teryx has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 65% by 2030 from a 2018 base year, and has set public commitments to switch to 100% renewable energy in its own operations, but it's not clear if the renewable energy will be additional to the grid.
