{"brand":"Allbirds","path":"allbirds","grade":"D+","summary":"Allbirds' recently released Flight Plan demonstrates that the company is taking its responsibility to address climate change seriously, but its commitments to reduce GHG emissions 42% miss the mark when it comes to achieving the reductions necessary for a 1.5 degree pathway. While the popular shoe brand has reported considerable progress in shifting away from fossil fuel based materials to low carbon alternatives for its shoes, the company's efforts to drive renewable energy in the manufacturing of its products places it behind other leading sneaker brands. The company should increase its investment in renewable energy in its supply chain and should become more transparent in terms of reporting its scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions beyond disclosing the carbon footprint of its products. Allbirds should also require its suppliers to disclose their emissions, set targets and provide facility-level energy data via the Higg Index.","commitments_grade":"C-","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Allbirds has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 42% by 2030 from a 2020 base year, and it has set public commitments to switch to 100% renewable energy in its own operations by December 2025, but it's not clear if the renewable energy will be additional to the grid.
