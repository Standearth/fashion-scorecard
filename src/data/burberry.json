{"brand":"Burberry","path":"burberry","grade":"D-","summary":"Burberry has taken critical initial steps to set itself on the path to tackling climate change, including by recently strengthening its emissions reduction target for its supply chain to 46% by 2030. But in order for the company to meet this target, it needs to commit to and rapidly invest in driving the deployment and use of renewable energy in its supply chain. The company should also become more transparent about its suppliers as well as its energy usage in its supply chain. Burberry should build on its strong deforestation policy when it comes to materials and take action to replace fossil fuel based materials such as polyester with low carbon alternatives and prioritize switching its cotton to organic or regenerative types.","commitments_grade":"D+","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Burberry has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 95% by 2030 from a 2016 base year and has set public commitments to switch to 100% renewable energy in its own operations, but it's not clear if the renewable energy will be additional to the grid.
