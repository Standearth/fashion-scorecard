{"brand":"Nike","path":"nike","grade":"C+","summary":"Footwear giant Nike is the highest scoring brand assessed in this scorecard, thanks to the iconic brand's leading efforts to deploy renewable energy in its supply chain, advocate for increased access to those renewable, and its work with suppliers to remove heavily polluting thermal coal boilers, and other energy efficiency measures in its supply chain. Despite Nike's reputation for innovation that includes its novel materials, Nike could do more to reduce its reliance on fossil fuel based fabrics and phse out non-organic or non-regenerative cotton.","commitments_grade":"B","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Nike has recently set absolute GHG emissions targets of 65% by 2025 from a 2015 base year for its own operations, and 100% renewable energy in its own operations. Nike has pursued a mixture of smaller onsite renewable projects with larger renewable energy PPAs in the US and EU. Renewable energy from these projects should not be applied to meet Nike’s electricity demand outside of the regions they deliver power to.
