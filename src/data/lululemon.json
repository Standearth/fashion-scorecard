{"brand":"Lululemon","path":"lululemon","grade":"D-","summary":"The yoga pants leader Lululemon has much work to attain the sustainable status it so effectively projects in its branding. The company has set a supply chain intensity-based climate target, which will fall far short if the company hopes to keep its climate pollution below the 1.5C warming threshold. Worse still, it has yet to meaningfully act on its supply chain climate target, not having worked with suppliers to increase energy efficiency, phase out coal usage, or to source renewable energy. The immensly popular brand has shown some willingness to advocate for policies to bring down global GHG emissions, yet it should apply those efforts in supply chain countries in order to help its suppliers obtain renewable energy. Lululemon also must greatly reduce its reliance on fossil fuel-based fabrics if it is to achieve significant GHG emissions reductions.","commitments_grade":"C-","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Lululemon has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 60% by 2030 from a 2018 base year and has set public commitments to switch to 100% renewable energy in its own operations, but not all the renewable energy will be additional to the grid.
