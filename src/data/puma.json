{"brand":"PUMA","path":"puma","grade":"C","summary":"Innovative sportswear brand PUMA has been an early adopter of climate targets, but has chosen to use an intensity-based target in scope 3, putting its overall emissions reductions work at risk. However, implementation may be a better measure than targets, and PUMA has made significant progress working with its suppliers to source renewables and increase energy efficiency in its manufacturing. Backing up these efforts, the brand has also advocated for decreasing coal useage in supply chain countries. PUMA could improve its efforts to reduce the impacts of its materials by reducing its reliance on fossil fuel based materials and cotton that is neither organic or regenerative.","commitments_grade":"C+","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>PUMA has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 35% by 2030 from a 2017 base year in its own operations and has set a commitment to switch to 100% renewable energy but not all of the renewable energy will be additional to the grid.
