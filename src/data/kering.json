But the company's scope 3 intensity-based targets fall short of achieving the GHG emissions reduction needed by 2030, in line with a 1.5 degree pathway. The company is lagging far behind its competitors when it comes to taking action to help its supply chain partners switch to renewable energy from coal and other fossil fuel based energy sources. The company should take immediate steps to invest in decarbonizing its manufacturing supply chain by incentivizing the use and deployment of renewable energy and should prioritize phasing out fossil fuel based materials such as polyester.","commitments_grade":"D","commitments_summary":"<h4>Climate commitments</h4><p><strong>In own operations </strong><br/>Kering has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 90% by 2030 from a 2015 base year and has set public commitments to switch to 100% renewable energy in its own operations, but it's not clear if the renewable energy will be additional to the grid. <span class=footnote><sup>1</sup></span></p><p><strong>In the supply chain </strong><br/>Kering has set an intensity-based target to reduce GHG emissions 70% per unit by 2030 from a 2015 base year, but the company has not set commitments to purchase or switch to renewable energy in its supply chain. <span class=footnote><sup>2</sup></span></p><h4>GHG emissions and energy transparency</h4><p><strong>In own operations </strong><br/>Kering annually reports GHG emissions in its own operations, but it does not report energy demand or renewable energy consumption and attributes. <span class=footnote><sup>3</sup></span></p><p><strong>In the supply chain </strong><br/>Kering has not publicly reported its list of suppliers but it reports the annual GHG emissions associated with its supply chain.
