The company remains far behind other leading brands in the athletic apparel sector when it comes to commitments to using and deploying renewable energy. The company should build on its progress in shifting to low carbon materials by committing to strong targets to switch to renewable energy not only in its own operations but also in its supply chain. The company should follow these commitments with immediate and transparent action to invest in renewable energy and the phaseout of coal and other fossil fuels from the manufacturing of its products. On Running should also disclose its GHG emissions annually as well as energy demand and use of renewable energy.","commitments_grade":"F","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>On Running has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 46% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline but has not set commitments to purchase or switch to renewable energy in its own operations.
