{"brand":"REI","path":"rei","grade":"D","summary":"REI has set strong GHG emissions reduction targets in all scopes, including manufacturing, aligning itself with the Paris Accord and a 1.5 degree pathway. But the company is lagging behind other competitors in the outdoor apparel and equipment sector when it comes to incentivizing suppliers of its REI brand products to use renewable energy or to implement energy efficiency measures. REI should take immediate steps to invest in a shift from coal and other fossil fuels to renewable energy to power the manufacturing of its products and materials, and disclose these actions, if it wants to remain competitive as an outdoor apparel brand that values sustainability. The company should also take steps and invest in innovation that would reduce its reliance on fossil fuel derived materials.","commitments_grade":"B-","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>REI has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions from its own operations and supply chain 55% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline and reports that it \"has powered its entire operations with 100 percent renewable energy through a combination of on-site solar, utility green tariffs and renewable energy certificates.\" [1]</p><h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 3) </h4><p>REI has set a GHG emissions reduction target of 55% by 2030 from a 2019 base year in its supply chain, but it has not set commitments to increase renewable energy in its supply chain.
