UNIQLO's climate commitments and its dearth of action to implement thos commitments are all small in scale and the company runs the risk of greenwashing over its value chain climate pollution. Instead, UNIQLO should scale up its work to cut emissions in the mills it contracts, increase all climate targets, begin to access renewable energy in its supply chain, and to reduce its reliance on fossil fuel based materials.","commitments_grade":"D","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Fast Retailing has not set targets to reduce absolute GHG emissions or to switch to renewable energy across all of its own operations.
