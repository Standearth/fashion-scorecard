{"brand":"American Eagle Outfitters","path":"american-eagle","grade":"F","summary":"American Eagle Outfitters is in the early stages of tackling its climate pollution and could easily fall behind its peers if it doesn't swiftly scale up its ambition and implementation. The popular brand made waves when it announced its supply chain climate target in late 2019, but that target is no longer industry-leading nor strong enough to meet the ambition required today. The company lags in transparency, failing to even make its suppliers public. AEO will need to rapidly scale up its infant energy efficiency work with suppliers and tackle sourcing renewable energy in the supply chain to meet its current target and then get onto a 1.5 degree pathway.","commitments_grade":"D+","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>AEO has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 80% by 2030 from a 2018 baseline and has set public commitments to switch to 100% renewable energy in its own operations, but it's not clear if the renewable energy will be additional to the grid.
