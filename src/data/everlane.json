{"brand":"Everlane","path":"everlane","subsidiaries":"","category":"casual","grade":"F","summary":"Everlane has received a failing grade in this scorecard, but the small company is showing signs of an increasing focus on and commitment to curbing its climate pollution. Like many companies in the early stages of action, Everlane is still in the climate target-setting stage, but has already sourced 100% of its scope 1 and 2 energy from renewables and actively prioritizes those factories it contracts with that are using renewables. Everlane stands out among its peers for clearly committing to eliminating virgin fossil fuel based fabrics by this year. If the company continues on its current path, it is likely to show noteworthy climate leadership in the near future.","commitments_grade":"F","commitments_summary":"<h4>Climate commitments</h4><p><strong>In own operations </strong><br/>Everlane has not set targets to reduce absolute GHG emissions or to switch to renewable energy in its own operations, but the company reports it sources 100% renewable energy through RECs, for which it has received partial credit. <span class=footnote><sup>1</sup></span></p><p><strong>In the supply chain </strong><br/>Everlane has not set targets to reduce absolute GHG emissions or to switch to renewable energy in its supply chain.</p><h4>GHG emissions and energy transparency</h4><p><strong>In own operations </strong><br/>Everlane has not publicly reported GHG emissions, energy demand and renewable energy consumption and attributes in its own operations, but does report sourcing 100% RE via RECs, for which it has received partial credit. <span class=footnote><sup>2</sup></span></p><p><strong>In the supply chain </strong><br/>Everlane publishes its list of suppliers but it has not publicly reported the GHG emissions, energy demand and renewable energy consumption and attributes associated with its supply chain. <span class=footnote><sup>3</sup></span></p>","commitments_notes":"<li>[1] Everlane.
