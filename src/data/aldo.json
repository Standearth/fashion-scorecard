{"brand":"ALDO","path":"aldo","category":"shoes","grade":"F","summary":"ALDO is failing to take meaningful action to address climate change. The global footwear company's weak intensity-based GHG emission reduction targets of 30% by 2030 position the company as a clear laggard among its competitors in the footwear and apparel space. The company should strive to become more transparent about its GHG emissions in its supply chain and needs to move quickly to invest in deploying renewable energy in its supply chain if it's serious about tackling its climate emissions by 2030. The company should also develop an action plan to phase out fossil fuel based materials, starting with virgin ones, and commit to clear targets to switch to low carbon, non-fossil alternatives.
