{"brand":"H&M","path":"hm","subsidiaries":"","category":"fast","grade":"C-","summary":"The iconic fast fashion giant H&M is poised to bring its climate pollution down to a 1.5 degree pathway, yet the brand has considerable progress to achieve before it becomes a climate leader in many areas. H&M has done much to advocate for access to renewable energy in supply chain countries, which is a critical step to cleaning up value chains. And while H&M has signaled its desire to be a climate leader, it must first rapidly scale up its targets and its financial support for both energy efficiency measures and the use of renewables in its supply chain. H&M will also bring down its emissions when it begins to rely less on fossil fuel based materials in all forms.","commitments_grade":"C-","commitments_summary":"<h4>Climate commitments</h4><p><strong>In own operations </strong><br/>H&M has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 40% by 2030 from a 2017 base year in its own operations and has set a commitment to switch to 100% renewable energy but only some of that energy will be additional to the grid.
