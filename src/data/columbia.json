{"brand":"Columbia","path":"columbia","category":"athletic,shoes,outdoor","grade":"D-","summary":"Columbia is one of the few companies that has neither set any form of reduction target for its own operations and supply chain, nor even signed the UN Fashion Charter on Climate Change. Despite having powering with clean energy as a core strategy for its sustainability efforts, Columbia has not actually set targets to switch to renewable energy in its supply chain. Columbia should publicly commit to reducing climate emissions from its supply chain 55% by 2030 and invest in decarbonizing its manufacturing, starting with the phaseout of coal, as well as a rapid shift to 100% renewable energy. The company should also set targets to eliminate fossil fuel based synthetics and switch to low-carbon alternatives.","commitments_grade":"D-","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Columbia has not set targets to reduce absolute GHG emissions or to switch to renewable energy in its own operations.</p><h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 3) </h4><p>Columbia has not set targets to reduce absolute GHG emissions or to switch to renewable energy in its supply chain.</p><h4>Transparency</h4><p>Columbia publishes only the most basic information on GHG emissions and renewable energy consumption for its own operations and does not report energy demand or details on source of renewable energy. <span class=footnote><sup>1</sup></span></p><p>Columbia provides more detail on the GHG emissions in its supply chain, with some breakout of emissions by both tier and material.
