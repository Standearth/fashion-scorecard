Ralph Lauren is transparent with its deadstock, a small but noteworthy sign of leadership.","commitments_grade":"D","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Ralph Lauren has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2020 base year and has set a commitment to switch to 100% renewable energy in its own operations but not all of the renewable energy will be additional to the grid.
