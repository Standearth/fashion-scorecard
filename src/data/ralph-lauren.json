{"brand":"Ralph Lauren","path":"ralph-lauren","category":"casual,luxury","grade":"D","summary":"Ralph Lauren's efforts to advocate for access to renewable energy in Vietnam and for sector alignment with the Paris Accord is contrasted with its less than aggressive work to rein in its own climate pollution. While the popular brand has not done nearly enough to clean up its manufacturing with renewable energy, it has shown a willingness to reduce its reliance on virgin fossil fuel based materials, an effort it should rapidly scale to encompass all fossil fuel based materials. Ralph Lauren is transparent with its deadstock, a small but noteworthy sign of leadership.","commitments_grade":"D","commitments_summary":"<h4>Climate commitments</h4><p><strong>In own operations </strong><br/>Ralph Lauren has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2020 base year and has set a commitment to switch to 100% renewable energy in its own operations but not all of the renewable energy will be additional to the grid. <span class=footnote><sup>1, 2</sup></span></p><p><strong>In the supply chain </strong><br/>Ralph Lauren has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2020 base year, but the company has not set commitments to purchase or switch to renewable energy in its supply chain. <span class=footnote><sup>3</sup></span></p><h4>GHG emissions and energy transparency</h4><p><strong>In own operations </strong><br/>Ralph Lauren annually reports GHG emissions, energy demand and renewable energy consumption, but it does not explicitly report how much of the renewable energy it consumed is additional to the grid. <span class=footnote><sup>4</sup></span></p><p><strong>In the supply chain </strong><br/>Ralph Lauren has not publicly reported its list of suppliers and it only reports the annual GHG emissions associated with its supply chain.
