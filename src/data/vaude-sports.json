{"brand":"VAUDE Sports","path":"vaude-sports","grade":"D","summary":"The German outdoor gear brand VAUDE has long been sourcing renewable energy in its own operations--which notably includes a portion of the company's manufacturing, and experimenting with methods to develop true closed loop recycling in order to address its GHG emissions footprint. As a small company, VAUDE will need to continue its collaborative work in order to source renewable energy in its supply chain. The company will also need to continue its efforts to find alternatives to fossil fuel based fabrics and closing the recycling loop.
