{"brand":"Levi's","path":"levis","grade":"C","summary":"One of the highest scoring brands on this scorecard, the iconic jeans maker Levi's has made significant progress piloting energy efficiency measures and exploring renewable energy installations in it supply chain, and is ready to rapidly scale up the projects to make significant GHG emissions cuts. Furthermore, Levi's has taken bold steps to advocate for access to renewable energy in supply chain countries. Levi's has set strong climate targets; however, those targets do not cover the company's shipping emissions and the company's emissions reporting may be in need of quality control. Levi's should also focus on reducing its reliance on coal boilers at its wet processing sites, paving the way for the next generation of fashion climate leaders.","commitments_grade":"C+","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Levi's has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 90% by 2025 from a 2016 base year and has set public commitments to switch to 100% renewable energy in its own operations, but it's not clear if the renewable energy will be additional to the grid. Aside from the deployment of solar panels to meet the partial energy needs of one of its distribution facilitities, Levi's continues to rely heavily on unbundled certificate purchases for most of its progress toward its renewable energy goal.

Levi's received additional credit reflecting the strength of its supply chain target. [2]</p><h4>Transparency</h4><p>Levi's annually reports GHG emissions, energy demand and renewable energy consumption and attributes in its own operations. Levi's received only partial credit for not explicitly reporting how much of the renewable energy consumed in its own operations is additional to the grid. [3]</p><p>Levi's publicly reports its list of suppliers and it only reports the annual GHG emissions associated with its supply chain. However, it would appear little actual measurement is taking place prior to reporting supply chain manufacturing emissions, as their figures were identifical for three consecutive years. So Levi's has received partial credit instead of full credit. Levi's does not annually report energy demand or renewable energy consumption and attributes in its supply chain.

After partnering with the IFC on a pilot program, Levi's is scaling up its financial support for energy efficiency measures to include major suppliers, including all wet process suppliers. Having built a stronger partnership with suppliers to facilitate key improvements in energy efficiency, Levi's needs to expand its focus to prioritize the elimination of coal and partner with its suppliers to not only conduct feasibility studes for renewable energy, but also provide financial incentives and longer-term contracts to those suppliers who make the necessary investments to phase out coal. [6]</p><p>Levi's provides financial incentives to some of its suppliers to reduce reliance on fossil fuel energy by deploying or using renewable energy. Levi's has provided some support for feasability assessments for suppliers participating under the PaCT, which helps to support some of its major suppliers in deploying or using more renewable energy and has partnered with IFC on the Global Trade Supplier Finance (GTSF) program since 2014. GTSF offers working capital at lower rates to suppliers that are meeting key social and environmental metrics. Levi's has incorporated emissions reductions and renewable energy use into the evaluation criteria.
