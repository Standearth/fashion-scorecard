{"brand":"Salomon","path":"salomon","grade":"D-","summary":"Salomon is falling behind other leading outdoor brands in its response to climate change. The company's climate emission reduction targets of 30% are far below the 55% reduction needed by 2030 in keeping with a 1.5 degree pathway. While the company supported a letter to the Government of Vietnam calling for implementation of renewable energy programs, it has not demonstrated meaningful progress in investing in renewable energy in its supply chain. The company needs to provide financial incentives to its manufacturing partners to switch from coal and other fossil fuel based energy sources to renewables and to chart a clear plan for reducing the climate impact of its materials by phasing out fossil fuel materials for low carbon alternatives.","commitments_grade":"D+","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Salomon has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2018 base year, but it has not set commitments to purchase or switch to renewable energy in its own operations.
