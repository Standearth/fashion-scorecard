{"brand":"Guess","path":"guess","grade":"F","summary":"Guess has made initial, cursury motions to rein in its climate pollution, but the popular brand has not done nearly enough to be considered a climate leader. Despite setting climate targets, Guess has not yet begun prioritizing energy efficiency or renewables in its supply chain. Nor has the company done much to decrease its reliance on fossil fuel-based materials. Guess should begin setting stronger targets and commitments, including in its own operations, and begin to rapidly deploy renewables throughout its supply chain.","commitments_grade":"D+","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Guess has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 50% from a 2019 base year by 2030 but has not set commitments to purchase or switch to renewable energy in its own operations.

The company has a take-back program called Resourced that has collected over 75,000 kg of apparel and footwear since May 2018, but the company does not report the amount resold or recycled into new garments. Hence the company received only partial credit. Guess reports that \"as part of its eco materials targets for 2020, GUESS endeavors to seek out man-made cellulosic materials made with closed-loop solutions.
