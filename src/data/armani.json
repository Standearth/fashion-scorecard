The company has not yet set GHG emissions reduction targets for its supply chain, where the majority of its climate pollution is generated, nor has it begun to incentivize pollution-reducing measures by its manufacturing partners. Armani Group needs to take steps to ensure the phaseout of coal from its supply chain by 2030 and invest in rapidly increasing the use of renewable energy such as solar if it's serious about tackling climate change. The company should also disclose its supply chain emissions and energy use regularly and chart a plan for phasing out fossil fuel based materials for low carbon alternatives, prioritizing materials such as organic cotton and non-synthetics that do not contribute to deforestation.
