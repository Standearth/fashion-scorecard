{"brand":"New Balance","path":"new-balance","grade":"D","summary":"New Balance has taken important first steps in reducing its climate footprint. But the company's GHG emissions reduction targets fall short of achieving the reductions necessary for a 1.5 degree pathway. New Balance should build on its actions to help increase energy efficiency in its manufacturing by investing in the deployment of renewable energy in its supply chain, starting with replacing coal boilers and electricity. The company should also develop a plan to phase out fossil fuel based materials, starting with virgin materials, and build on its programs to reuse and recycle its own textiles by committing to investing in closed loop recycling of apparel and other goods.

New Balance reports that it is working on expanding footwear and apparel repair services as well as improving the longevity of its products. The company has not made commitments to close the apparel recycling loop or eliminate materials such as leather and viscose that contribute to deforestation, but the company has identified TENCEL as a preferred material, for which it received partial credit.

The company has a takeback program but does not report using products it receives for resale or closed-loop recycling purposes. New Balance reports progress on reducing deadstock by reporting that \"more than half of our strategic footwear and apparel suppliers have reported incorporating at least some pre-consumer scrap back into making new materials, either at their own facilities or at a nearby site. Nearly 20% say they incorporate most or all of their manufacturing scrap. And nearly 40% offer a takeback program to close the loop between Tier One and Tier Two suppliers.
