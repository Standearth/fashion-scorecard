{"brand":"PVH","path":"pvh","category":"casual","grade":"D+","summary":"PVH demonstrates mediocre progress in all areas but reporting illuminates an opportunity for the company to pinpoint its efforts to rapidly decrease it supply chain emissions. PVH has found that three quarters of energy use and 70% of emissions is centered at a mere 35 facilities, and that their remaining onsite coal usage is happening at a miniscule 6% of those facilities. PVH is on the brink of phasing out its onsite thermal coal usage and could lead the industry in emissions reductions by investing in renewables at the facilities identified.","commitments_grade":"D","commitments_summary":"<h4>Climate commitments</h4><p><strong>In own operations </strong><br/>PVH has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2017 base year in its own operations and has set a commitment to switch to 100% renewable energy in its own operations but not all of the renewable energy will be additional to the grid. <span class=footnote><sup>1</sup></span></p><p><strong>In the supply chain </strong><br/>PVH has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2017 base year, but the company has not set commitments to purchase or switch to renewable energy in its supply chain. <span class=footnote><sup>2</sup></span></p><h4>GHG emissions and energy transparency</h4><p><strong>In own operations </strong><br/>PVH annually reports GHG emissions, energy demand and renewable energy consumption and attributes in its own operations to the CDP.
