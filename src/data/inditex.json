The brand's steps to install renewable energy projects helps ensure that the energy will be truly additional to the grid, but Inditex is not doing nearly enough for renewables or even energy efficiency measures in its supply chain. Additionally, Inditex should make its supply chain transparent, an easy and increasingly common step for companies displaying climate leadership.","commitments_grade":"D+","commitments_summary":"<h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 1 & 2) </h4><p>Inditex has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 90%, which is greater than 55%, by 2030, and the company committed to 80% renewable energy by 2025. <span class=footnote><sup>1, 2</sup></span></p><h4>GHG emission reduction targets (scope 3) </h4><p>Inditex has set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions in its supply chain by 20% by 2030, which is below 40% reduction, but the company has not set commitments to purchase or switch to renewable energy in its supply chain. <span class=footnote><sup>3</sup></span></p><h4>Transparency</h4><p>Inditex annually reports its GHG emissions, energy demand and renewable energy consumption and attributes in its own operations. <span class=footnote><sup>4</sup></span></p><p>Inditex has not publicly reported its list of suppliers and it reports the annual GHG emissions.
