LVMH demonstrated limited progress in increasing the recycled content in its products, reducing deadstock and recycling some of its own products or other apparel in a closed-loop system, for which it received partial credit. For example, the company reported that some products under the Fendi brand utilized \"previous collection samples, dormant stock and archive pieces\" and Be Mindful accessories by Louis Vuitton used unsold silk scarves. Another Louis Vuitton collection and the its LV trainer utilized previous and surplus products and materials. Another example is a recycling scheme by Celine that makes use of leather scraps. The company also reports limited progress in increasing the repairability of its products citing that one of its brands, Berluti, \"maintains and repairs half the leather goods it sells.\" LVMH reported working with Canopy to develop responsible sourcing of viscose, for which it received partial credit since it did not report progress in phasing out materials linked to deforestation. <span class=footnote><sup>4</sup></span></p>","materials_notes":"<li>[3] LVMH.
