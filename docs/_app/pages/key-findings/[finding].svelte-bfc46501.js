For example, according to the International Energy Agency, coal makes up 47% of the electricity grid in Vietnam.<span class=footnote><sup>[2]</sup></span> In-house supply chain research by the Stand Research Group uncovered that in 2019 the companies included in the Scorecard collectively imported more than 216,682 metric tonnes of apparel and related goods from Vietnam into the United States alone. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Unless fashion brands invest in the decarbonization of energy grids in countries like Vietnam, whose economies are driven in no small part by textile and apparel manufacturing, and put pressure on both supply chain partners and policymakers to increase the deployment of renewable energy, coal power will continue to be a major source of energy in the fashion industry, and may in fact expand. Vietnam’s proposed Power Development Plan for the period of 2021-2030 aims to increase the capacity of coal-fired power plants in the country by 30 gigawatts (GW) – enough to power more than 22 million American homes – with 24 new coal power plants being proposed. In addition to the filthy fuel’s severe climate impacts, the potential expansion of coal in the country would cause 1,500 additional premature deaths every year in Vietnam.<span class=footnote><sup>[3]</sup></span> </p>",kf1_body_2:"<p>In addition to coal-based electricity, the fashion industry continues to rely heavily on coal-fired water boilers, used in the fabric dyeing and finishing processes, and contributes to vast amounts of GHG emissions and deadly air pollution in communities surrounding manufacturing facilities. Thermal coal continues to be responsible for a major proportion of emissions originating from Tier 2 of the apparel industry supply chain, which is estimated to produce 40% of the industry’s entire emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Fracked Fashion and Fossil Fuel Fabrics</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Synthetic materials derived from fossil fuels such as crude oil and fracked gas now constitute roughly two-thirds of all fibers used in textiles and garments.<span class=footnote><sup>[4]</sup></span> The production of fossil fuel fabrics is much more energy-intensive than plant-based materials such as organic cotton. In fact, the production of fossil fuel fabrics, including polyester, nylon and acrylic, accounts for 15 to 20% of the fashion sector’s climate emissions.<span class=footnote><sup>[5]</sup></span> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The dependence on cheap fossil fuel derived fabrics such as polyester has enabled the highly-polluting fast fashion model, and the projected growth in the use of these plastic fibers, fueled by the fracking boom, will only perpetuate the fast fashion problem, undermining the sector’s efforts to drastically cut emissions and to shift to circular production.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The environmental footprint of these fabrics extends beyond the GHG emissions associated with extraction and production, to their massive contribution to the global plastic pollution crisis through the shedding of plastic microfibers that scientists have detected in every corner of the planet as well as in the human body. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Despite growing opposition to hydraulic fracking by communities and policymakers, including increasing government bans on this method of fossil fuel extraction, Stand.earth Research Group researchers have uncovered major supply chain links from U.S. fracked gas to polyester producers supplying the global apparel industry. The research tracked ethane – used to produce ethylene – from fracked gas coming from Texas and Pennsylvania to Ineos, a major European importer of ethane. (Texas and Pennsylvania shipped over 1.3 million tonnes of ethane to Europe in 2019, mostly to Ineos). Ineos manufactures ethylene oxide and its derivative monoethylene glycol, from which polyester is derived, and is the largest producer of ethylene oxide in Western Europe, with a capacity of 935,000 tons annually. The research estimates around one-third of Ineos’ capacity ends up as polyester fiber used by the fashion industry, including polyester made by the Ineos’ customer Indorama Ventures, one of the world’s largest producers of polyester fiber.</p>",kf1_body_3:"<p>The continued dependence on fossil fuel synthetics will contribute to driving the sector’s GHG emissions and undermine global progress in curbing the demand for fossil fuels. As a result, fashion brands can no longer ignore the carbon footprint and local impacts of their fracked and other fossil fuel fabrics if they are serious about meeting their climate reduction targets and commitment to sustainability.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Growing consumer consciousness of the environmental and social harms associated with fast fashion presents a golden opportunity for fashion brands to rethink the design of their products to make them last longer. Replacing plastic materials such as polyester with non-fossil fuel derived synthetics is a critical first step toward a slower and more circular fashion business model.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Shipping Emissions</h3>\r\n<p>The sprawling global supply chain of the fashion sector is already an important driver in the growth of emissions from ocean freight and air cargo shipments, sectors that are heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Each mode is responsible for 2 to 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is rapidly increasing. Apparel and textiles were among the largest market segments in both ocean and air shipping in 2019, with 8% of ocean cargo freight volume and 6% of air cargo.<span class=footnote><sup>[6]</sup></span> Container ships also contribute significantly to air pollution due to their reliance on toxic heavy fuel oil. Ocean shipping is projected to increase to 17% of global GHG emissions if no action is taken. Apparel and textiles were among the largest market segments in both ocean and air shipping in 2019, with 8% of ocean cargo freight volume and 6% of air cargo.<span class=footnote><sup>[7]</sup></span></p>\r\n<p>As one of the largest customers of both ocean and air freight, fashion and apparel brands have an opportunity to serve as critical catalysts in reducing emissions from air freight and to drive the investment needed in both ships and port infrastructure to decarbonize cargo vessels by the end of the decade. Several global brands have begun to engage on pilot approaches to reduce their shipping footprint, but much stronger demand for decarbonization, along with near-term demands requiring the elimination of toxic heavy fuel oil by cargo ship fleet operators serving major fashion brands, could help trigger much needed investment in zero-emission ocean freight.</p>",kf1_notes:"<ol><li>\r\nCarbon Brief.

The moment we are currently in – having less than one decade to dramatically reduce global GHG emissions – dictates we must slash total absolute global emissions 55% from 2018 levels by 2030 in order to keep global warming below 1.5℃.<span class=footnote><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The fashion sector's climate ambition is not meeting the moment we are in. Despite important progress that has been made under the UN Fashion Climate Charter, establishing a 30% reduction in supply chain emissions by 2030 as a benchmark agreed to by 128 companies, the near daily reminder of floods, fires, and heat is reaffirming the science that much more dramatic reduction in pollution is needed by 2030. With notable exceptions, companies are not yet setting strong enough climate targets and the sector is on an emissions trajectory far from a 1.5℃ pathway. Setting strong climate targets should not be overlooked, because they serve as the blueprint for implementation plans and send powerful signals to the market for greater demand for renewable energy solutions. The recent decision by the Sustainable Apparel Coalition to require a 45% reduction target as a requirement of its members is an important step toward increasing the sector's ambition at a broad level.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, strong climate targets should cover the entire value chain and must result in absolute reductions. Intensity-based climate targets link emissions reductions to a performance based on units or revenue, potentially allowing a company to continue to grow its output without reducing total emissions. While intensity-based targets can play a useful role in assessing progress toward decarbonizing the value chain, they should be complemented with clear absolute GHG reduction targets or 100% renewable energy goals that apply across the supply chain. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Some companies evaluated in the Scorecard have set intensity-based climate targets in scope 3 instead of absolute targets (see table below). These intensity-based targets fall short of the ambition required, especially when measured against companies that have set absolute targets, such as Mammut’s 55% reduction by 2030 or Asics’ 63% reduction in emissions by 2030 (from purchased goods and services and end-of-life treatment of sold products).</p>",kf2_body_2:"<h3>Importance of Transparency</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Without a clear understanding where the carbon is buried in any given supply chain, it is impossible to assess a company’s progress in reaching its climate targets. Leading companies regularly make public their GHG emissions, energy demand, and the specifics associated with renewable energy purchase and use across entire value chains, and publish up-to-date supplier lists. Companies meeting the level of leadership defined here in their own operations include Inditex, M&S, Nike, Patagonia, PUMA, REI, VAUDE, and VF Corp; but Nike stood out as the only company to exhibit leadership with respect to transparency on its climate emissions and energy use across its entire value chain. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Renewable Energy Commitments</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Renewable energy targets of 100% in scopes 1 and 2 are common, though there is significant variation in the impact of procurement strategies to achieve 100% renewable goals. Climate leaders will ensure that the renewable energy will be both local and additional to the grid – as opposed to continuing to rely on coal or other fossil fuel based electricity – while purchasing credits for renewable energy in a different location. But companies must also set renewable energy targets, covering manufacturing whether under direct control of the company or not. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This level of leadership is currently very rare within the fashion sector. Mammut, an outdoor apparel brand, stood out in this regard by recently committing to switching to 100% renewable energy in its entire supply chain, including manufacturing operations not directly under its control. This level of ambition sets an example for other brands to follow. In addition to Mammut, four of the companies assessed in this scorecard have publicly set renewable energy targets in the supply chain, notably three of which are footwear brands: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Allbirds has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy for Tier 1 suppliers.<span class=footnote><sup>[3]</sup></span> </li>\r\n<li>Asics states it will achieve 85% renewable electricity in Tier 1 by 2030.<span class=footnote><sup>[4]</sup></span> </li>\r\n<li>PUMA has a commitment to source 25% renewable energy with core suppliers.<span class=footnote><sup>[5]</sup></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Fashion brands can also look to other sectors for examples of leadership in renewable energy commitments and action. The IT sector, which has a geographically overlapping supply chain, has extended their 100% renewable energy goals to their supply chains. </p>",kf2_notes:"<ol><li>UNEP (2020).

A number of leading brands demonstrated some progress in flattening emissions through gains in energy efficiency, but the lack of focus on how fossil fuel investments are being made in their supply chain countries and resistance to partnering with suppliers by providing meaningful incentives to transition to renewable manufacturing is the core reason that the sector is so far from a 1.5℃ pathway. Of the 47 companies evaluated in the Scorecard, only six companies have demonstrated progress in deploying renewable energy in their supply chain, even fewer at any meaningful scale.</p> \r\n<p>Renewable energy is already the cheapest source of new power generation in most of the world, with the average global purchase for new utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind turbines able to beat or compete with even the cheapest and newest coal plants.<span class=footnote><sup>[1]</sup></span> Corporate demand for renewable energy, triggered by the growing number of companies who have set 100% renewable energy commitments, has become one the largest drivers of new renewable electricity generation in many markets. </p>\r\n<p>While some fashion leaders have taken meaningful steps to transition their own operations to renewable energy (Nike, Patagonia, and VF Corp), most fashion brands lag far behind in transitioning their supply chain to renewables. A recent <a href=”http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Net_Zero_Challenge_The_Supply_Chain_Opportunity_2021.pdf”>analysis commissioned by the World Economic Forum</a>, while confirming the fashion sector’s supply chain as one of the largest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions, also highlighted that fashion brands have the potential to reduce emissions by 50 to 60% by 2030 at low cost by focusing on transitioning their manufacturing base to renewable energy.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, while most countries are rapidly phasing out coal and scaling renewable electricity deployment, the manufacturing base of global fashion brands is heavily concentrated in the few countries in the world that are expanding their reliance on coal and other fossil fuels for electricity generation. While a significant number of proposed coal plants in Vietnam and Bangladesh have fortunately been scrapped in the past year, much of the required energy demand will be replaced with proposed imported LNG, potentially locking fashion brands and their suppliers into high-cost investments that will make it impossible to reduce manufacturing emissions at the scale needed by 2030.</p>\r\n<h3>Measuring Leadership Toward Fossil Free Manufacturing </h3>\r\n<p>Without stronger standards of reporting and commitment to additionality of supply (see below), there is a real danger that shortcuts being used by some companies to report progress toward their GHG or 100% renewable goals will weaken the resolve of current corporate renewable leaders to pursue high impact strategies. Without a deeper investigation, it is increasingly difficult to tell the difference between the renewable claims of a company that is actually pursuing a high impact strategy that is changing the energy mix on the grid from a similar sounding claim to be “climate positive,” “climate neutral,”or “Net Zero,” but is green in name only, as level of fossil fuels powering the factories remains largely unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Energy Efficiency Gains and Lack of Facility Level Reporting</h4>\r\n<p>Improving energy efficiency in the most energy-intensive areas of the apparel supply chain is a critical first step toward phasing out coal and replacing the reduced energy demand with renewable sources of energy. Leading companies are investing in capacity-building programs and financial incentives to help their suppliers drive significant improvements in energy efficiency, as most clearly evidenced by Levi’s, PUMA, and VF Corp’s work with a number of their priority suppliers via programs run by the IFC and the Clean by Design program now run by the Apparel Impact Institute (Aii). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, with few exceptions, reporting on progress in improving energy efficiency remains largely anecdotal, due in great part to the lack of detailed reporting of energy demand by the brands themselves. While more detailed factory-level data is reported to Higg Co. by a growing number of suppliers, this data is not made public. As an illustration, Levi’s, despite pre-pandemic GHG emissions from supply chain manufacturing 13% higher than its 2016 base year, saw its sales double in the same period, a potentially good indicator of meaningful improvements in energy efficiency by its 50-plus suppliers participating in IFC’s PaCT program. However, the lack of factory-level data and Levi’s own lack of detailed reporting of supply chain emissions, including reporting the exact same GHG emissions footprint for manufacturing emissions for three consecutive years, casts some doubt on the level of efficiency improvements achieved, putting much greater focus on the 13% increase in supply chain GHG pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Phasing Out Coal Boilers</h4>\r\n<p>Coal is used in two distinct ways in the manufacturing of apparel: to generate the electricity that factories use through local electric grids, and by burning it onsite for industrial boilers. Wet processes like textile dyeing are responsible for a large percentage of the fashion industry’s emissions that derive from onsite burning of fossil fuels. In many factories coal-fired boilers are still used to generate steam and hot water used in dyeing and finishing. While the UN Fashion Charter on Climate Change simply commits brands to stop adding new coal boilers by 2025, few companies find this commitment meaningful. Leading brands are now moving to phase out existing thermal coal in major supplier facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Asics is the only company to report that it has eliminated onsite coal burning at all of its Tier 1 supplier facilities.<span class=footnote><sup>[2]</sup></span></li>\r\n<li>Mammut committed to phase out coal use in its supply chain by 2030.</li>\r\n<li>PUMA committed to replace all coal-fired boilers at PUMA’s core suppliers, which includes both Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers.</li>\r\n<li>Nike has worked with suppliers across more than 40 facilities to replace thermal fossil fuel boiler systems with electrified boilers over the past six years, enabling further decarbonization through the purchase of renewable electricity, and has eliminated the direct use of coal in all footwear manufacturing.<span class=footnote><sup>[3]</sup></span></li>\r\n<li>Adidas and Esprit also indicated that they are working with supply chain partners to replace coal-fired boilers.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Assessing Supply Chain Renewable Electricity Strategy </h4>\r\n<p>A company whose strategy focuses on maximizing impact and changing the grid over the long term can serve as a powerful catalyst in driving investment in renewable generation, as well as moving both utilities and policymakers to prioritize bringing more renewable energy onto the grid. But some companies are simply seeking to secure the ability to claim a renewable energy supply, but not actually changing the mix of the electricity on the grid that are powering their operations or supply chains. High-impact strategies will include strong incentives for suppliers to focus on securing a renewable electricity supply that is local, additional, and from sustainable sources.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>An increasing number of brands are building supplier decision-making capacity on renewable energy options for their factories, either directly or through collaborative programs such as those run by the Apparel Impact Institute. But with payback times on site renewables generally longer than energy efficiency investments, and renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs) typically much longer than supplier contracts, apparel brands need to provide financial or contractual incentives to show greater partnership to accelerate the deployment of renewables among key suppliers and to increase confidence that brands’ decisions on supply chain contracts will become dependent on suppliers having access to renewable electricity. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Highlights of Strategies to Incentivize Renewable Apparel Manufacturing:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><i>Requiring GHG Reduction Targets and Reporting of Facility Energy Performance</i></strong></p>\r\n<ul><li>Asics requires strategic Tier 1 suppliers to set emissions targets and strategic Tier 1 and some Tier 2 suppliers to share their emissions data using the SAC's Higg Index.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><i>Power Purchase Agreements</i></strong></p>\r\n<ul><li>Mammut’s supplier secured a renewable power purchase agreement that resulted in 60% reduction in GHG from manufacturing processes for core products.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><i>Rooftop Solar Deployment</i></strong></p>\r\n<ul><li>Nike launched a new factory rooftop solar photovoltaic deployment program, with particular focus on China, Vietnam and Indonesia.</li>\r\n<li>Adidas provided technical expertise for solar rooftop feasibility studies in key sourcing countries covering approximately 80% of strategic suppliers, resulting in 27 MW of rooftop solar to date.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><i>Shifting Supply Chain to Electricity Grids with More Renewables</i></strong></p>\r\n<ul><li>As part of Mammut’s 2030 Net Zero strategy, the company is shifting its supply chain to regions with high levels of renewable energy, including an additional 10% of their supply chain to Europe.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The lack of reporting of underlying energy demand or scale of manufacturing capacity connected with supply chain renewable energy projects, at a factory, supplier or even regional level remains a fundamental problem for assessing the impact of company efforts to transition their production of their products to renewable energy. Even among those companies who have taken some steps to deploy rooftop solar or other renewable energy projects in partnership with suppliers, the numerator amount of renewable energy is reported, but not the denominator energy context that would show whether the project is significant to the brand or the supplier. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Companies and suppliers that are serious about transitioning their supply chain to renewable energy sources will provide the energy demand and share of manufacturing capacity alongside details of the size and technology used in renewable energy projects, and provide regular updates on their progress at a country level (or regional level for larger countries). </p>",kf3_notes:"<ol><li>International Renewable Energy Agency.

The shift to energy intensive synthetic materials like polyester and nylon has been a central driver in the fashion’s sector’s rapid increase in GHG emissions, enabling the fast fashion business model that feeds rapid consumption and enormous waste throughout the production cycle that is clearly unsustainable and incompatible with addressing climate change. Consumer surveys and industry insiders have repeatedly signaled that the fast fashion model does not have a place in a post-pandemic world,<span class=footnote><sup>[1]</sup></span> strengthening the business case for fashion leaders to move materials away from polyester and other synthetic materials driving fossil fuel extraction, pollution, and high levels of waste.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Fossil Fuel Synthetics</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The most important marker of leadership in the area of materials in the Scorecard is demonstrating meaningful commitments and efforts to reduce the reliance on high-carbon fossil fuel synthetics such as fracked polyester (see Fashion’s Fossil Fuel Problem). While many brands have explicit commitments or indicated the desire to switch to more “sustainable” fabrics, a closer look at brand sustainability strategies illustrates that very few companies are in fact moving in the right direction in addressing the fossil fuel based synthetics and fracked fabrics.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Communicating to consumers and investors that sourcing recycled plastic from other waste streams is “sustainable” effectively amounts to greenwashing. This is due to several factors:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Relying on recycled fiber content from sources such as disposable plastic bottles or ocean plastic waste risks increasing demand for virgin fossil fuel feedstocks and polluting throwaway plastic products.</li>\r\n<li>Such recycled polyester and nylon items are most often used only once and become destined to be landfilled or incinerated, and until then will continue to emit countless microfibers into our oceans.</li>\r\n<li>Unless textiles and apparel generated by the fashion sector become the source of the recycled content feedstocks, brands are essentially perpetuating the problematic linear take-make-dispose system, which would further exacerbate the sector’s waste and climate pollution problem.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Leading sportswear and outdoor brands including adidas, Arc’teryx, Gap (Athleta), Columbia, Lululemon, MEC, New Balance, Patagonia, REI and Under Armour received an “F” grade on their materials in large part because of their lack of meaningful or any progress in setting targets to phase out fossil fuel synthetics and replace them with plant-based materials or recycled materials generated using closed-loop recycling that relies on discarded apparel and textiles. Many of these brands are doubling down on their use of fossil fuel fabrics by sourcing fibers recycled from single-use plastic bottles or other waste such as fishing nets, and making false sustainability claims in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The following brands are leading the sector with their efforts to eliminate fossil fuel based synthetics from their material mix:</p>\r\n<ul><li>VF Corp.’s outdoor brand, Icebreaker, is the only brand to commit to phasing out all fossil synthetics, including recycled, from all of their product lines by 2023.</li>\r\n<li>Allbirds has set a good example for footwear brands to follow by largely replacing fossil synthetics typically used in shoes with renewable and bio-based materials.</li>\r\n<li>Eileen Fisher, Kering, and Levi’s use a small percentage of fossil fuel synthetics in their entire fiber mix (less than 8%, 4% and 9%, respectively).</li>\r\n<li>Mammut successfully closed the recycling loop for one of its key and most energy-intensive products, climbing ropes. The company reports it works with Econyl, a nylon recycler, to recycle used ropes sold and collected by Mammut. Emissions associated with producing ropes constitute 13% of Mammut’s annual carbon footprint. The outdoor brand intends to expand closed-loop recycling of nylon-based products to its apparel and packs.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond efforts to phase out fossil fuel fabrics, brands that scored highly in the area of materials have also taken steps to ensure a shift to low-carbon plant- or animal-based fibers such as organic or regenerative cotton, leather, and viscose or other wood-derived materials that are verified to be of low deforestation risk.<span class=footnote><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Cotton</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Cotton is the second most widely used material by the fashion industry after polyester. While cotton generally requires less energy to produce compared to polyester or other synthetics, conventionally grown cotton is associated with a greater carbon footprint, significant toxic pesticide use and labor rights concerns compared to organic or regenerative cotton.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Growing pressure by consumers on brands to source more sustainable cotton led to the emergence of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), an industry-led initiative that sets certain ecological and labor parameters for growing cotton. However, independent analysis by the Changing Markets Foundation shows that BCI may have perpetuated the use of genetically modified cotton seeds and consequently continued dependence on toxic pesticide products that pose serious risk to human health and the environment.<span class=footnote><sup>[3]</sup></span></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Organic cotton vs. BCI</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Many brands that have set targets to source “sustainable” cotton are claiming progress toward meeting their targets by sourcing BCI cotton. This is a troubling trend in the fashion sector as BCI is associated with higher carbon emissions compared to organic or regenerative cotton and may pose serious environmental risks due to heavy dependence on harmful pesticides. One study of cotton farming in Maharashtra, India, shows BCI cotton has a Global Warming Potential lower than conventional cotton, but higher than that of organic cotton (435 to 731 and 295, respectively, per ton of seed cotton).<span class=footnote><sup>[4]</sup></span> Increasing demand for BCI may adversely impact the growth of organic cotton farming, making it more challenging for brands that want to switch source organic cotton. Nearly a third of the companies evaluated in the Scorecard have made commitments to source 100% organic cotton or have reached that goal. Other brands need to follow suit and work with suppliers and farmers to further drive the supply of organic or regenerative cotton.</p>\r\n\t</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Materials and Deforestation</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Conventional wood-based (or cellulosic) materials such as viscose and rayon can have a high carbon footprint as well as adverse impacts on biodiversity if sourced from practices that contribute to deforestation. The increasing availability of alternative cellulosic fibers that are sourced from sustainably managed forests such as TENCEL provides an opportunity for fashion brands to eliminate raw materials that may be driving deforestation, especially in sensitive ecosystems such as the Amazon or the boreal forest in North America. Yet many brands have not taken any steps to ensure their fabrics are not linked to deforestation. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 47 brands evaluated in the Scorecard, 19 brands (40%) did not have deforestation policies with respect to wood-based fibers such as viscose. These brands included leading sportswear and outdoor brands adidas, Arc’teryx, Asics, Columbia, MEC, Pentland, PUMA and the North Face (a subsidiary of VF Corp.) and the vast majority of luxury brands including Armani, Capri Holdings, Chanel, Kering, Prada and Salvatore Ferragamo. While some fast fashion brands have taken steps to source cellulosic fibers verified to have a low deforestation risk, Boohoo and UNIQLO have not put in place policies or guidelines for sourcing sustainable viscose or other cellulosic fibers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Sportswear, luxury and footwear brands such as ALDO face significant risk with respect to deforestation due to their reliance on animal-based leather as a primary raw material used for shoes, purses, luxury apparel and other accessories. Cattle ranching is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation globally, and leather makes up an important part of the business model that promotes the continued expansion of cattle ranching in the Amazon biome. Brands need to develop strong policies that prevent the sourcing of both wood-based materials and leather linked to deforestation. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Marks & Spencer’s (M&S) policy on leather, which requires suppliers to “annually disclose the country of slaughter of all our leather” and “exclude leather from cattle reared in the Amazon biome from [its] supply chains,” among other considerations, stands out as a good model for brands to follow in developing their deforestation policies.<span class=footnote><sup>[5]</sup></span></p>",kf5_notes:"<ol><li>McKinsey & Company, The State of Fashion 2020, Coronavirus Update (2020), also Weaving a Better Future: Rebuilding a More Sustainable Fashion Industry After COVID-19, https://apparelcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Weaving-a-Better-Future-Covid-19-BCG-SAC-Higg-Co-Report.pdf</li>\r\n<li>Canopy.

Emissions from marine shipping alone are currently estimated to be approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and on track to be as much as 17% by 2050 if left unregulated. Ship-based emissions from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, where clothing and shoes combined were the largest portion of marine cargo traffic in 2019, will soon be the largest source of smog-forming emissions in Southern California, disproportionately impacting lower income and communities of color surrounding the port.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its significant environmental impact and central role shipping plays in executing the business model of major apparel brands, reducing shipping pollution receives relatively little attention in the climate and sustainability strategies of most apparel brands, and has been dismissed by some brands as not being a priority. While shipping may represent a much smaller piece of a typical fashion brand's supply chain emissions, shipping related GHG emissions are often in fact much larger than the scope 1 and 2 climate pollution from their own operations that are typically central to their climate targets and solutions initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While 32 of 47 brands in the Scorecard report shipping related GHG emissions, only 18 (38%) of the brands included shipping in their scope 3 supply chain emissions reduction target. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Key strategies for fashion brands to adopt to tackle shipping related climate pollution:</p>\r\n<h4>Slower Shipping + Cleaner Fuels </h4>\r\n<p>Several brands claim to have set a preference to transition more of their product logistics from air shipping to (lower cost) ocean cargo freight, but stronger customer demand for cleaner fuels and ships is something that most apparel brands could do to provide the signal to global shipping companies to focus on reducing their emissions. A number of brands have committed broadly to shift more of cargo from air to marine shipping as part of their supply chain strategy, and Esprit and Mammut both setting specific 2030 reduction targets for shipping related GHG emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Creating Demand for Zero Emission Vessels + Phase Out Fossil Fueled Shipping</h4>\r\n<p>With apparel and textile representing one of the largest segments of containerized cargo shipping, global fashion brands have a huge opportunity to create the market demand needed for the deployment of Zero Emission Vessels (ZEVs), and avoid the wasted investment in both LNG ships and “Scrubbers” that are being installed to continue the reliance on highly toxic HFO (see scrubbers below). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Lower emission maritime shipping options, including hybrid sailing cargo vessels and zero-emission technology pathways using renewably produced ammonia and hydrogen have already begun to emerge, but strong demand from major shipping customers is recognized as critical to trigger the investment needed for a rapid shift away from fossil fuels like HFO to low and zero-carbon cargo vessels in the coming 5-10 years. By committing to relying exclusively on ZEV cargo shipping no later than 2030, fashion brands can play a major role in catalyzing the necessary investment in vessels and port infrastructure that will enable a deep decarbonization of shipping. Mammut has recently emerged as the first apparel brand to establish a commitment to 100% ZEV by 2030.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Wrong Turn: LNG </h4>\r\n<p>Investments in LNG-powered ships have been pursued at a limited but growing scale among cargo ship operators seeking to claim they have moved off of highly polluting HFO bunker fuels, and then presented to customers as a way to reduce shipping-related pollution. However, while LNG has the potential to significantly reduce sulfur related emissions compared to HFO, recent studies have shown that due to “methane slip” in LNG-powered engines, LNG ships produce even more GHG emissions than those powered by HFO. In addition to higher GHG emissions, much like the LNG solutions being considered on land for electricity generation, LNG powered shipping would require massive investments in new ships and port infrastructure for bunkering, which not only fails to deliver on the need for zero-emission, fossil-free shipping, it would drive higher emissions and higher costs from stranded assets once real pathways to decarbonized shipping are pursued.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Wrong Turn: HFO “Scrubbers”</h4>\r\n<p>Rather than shifting to cleaner marine fuels to comply with the IMO’s 2020 low sulfur standard, a number of global shipping companies have chosen instead to use the “scrubber loophole” to comply with the new regulation. This loophole allows shipping companies to continue to use highly toxic HFO bunker fuel to power ships, as long as the ships install scrubbers to remove sulfur from the exhaust, in essence simply converting air pollution into water pollution as the scrubber wastewater is discharged. This dumping of scrubber waste adds dangerous heavy metals to the water, while also significantly contributing to the acidification of the ocean that is already underway due to climate change. Fashion brands should insist their carriers rapidly transition away from HFO and fuel oil blends, selecting only those shipping companies and freight forwarders with ships that have converted to MGO or cleaner fuels, and avoiding those companies relying on scrubbers as a false solution.        </p>"};function z(e){let t,n;return{c(){t=o("h1"),n=i("404 Page not
